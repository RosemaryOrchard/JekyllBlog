# JekyllBlog

This is the code for my blog! It's using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and running on a virtual private server. It auto deploys using a GitHub workflow whenever changes are made to the main branch. Notice something wrong? Feel free to open an issue, make a pull request, or just tell me about it. Want to steal something I've made? Go for it! (Though I retain all rights to the content of my blog and request you make your theme different.)
