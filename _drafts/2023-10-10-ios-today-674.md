Join us on our virtual journey as we explore the world of CarPlay with iOS 17. We'll explain what CarPlay is, how it works, and how it differs from other infotainment systems. We'll also walk you through the process of setting up CarPlay in your car. If you've ever struggled with syncing data or deleting it from an unfamiliar system, particularly in rental cars, you'll find our tips on using CarPlay a lifesaver. CarPlay goes with you wherever you are, so you can use it in any car that supports it.
