In [episode 704 iOS Today](https://twit.tv/shows/ios-today/episodes/704)...
In this episode of iOS Today, Mikah Sargent and Rosemary Orchard discuss their experiences with Apple's newly released M4 iPad Pros and accessories. They cover the new features and improvements, including the OLED display, updated design, Magic Keyboard with function keys, and the new Apple Pencil Pro. Rosemary also addresses a listener's question about creating a shortcut to quickly access downtime settings on a Mac.

M4 iPad Pros:  
• The new iPad Pros have an OLED display, offering improved contrast and color reproduction  
• Storage options include 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB, with higher-tier models having more RAM and an extra performance core.  
• The Magic Keyboard has been updated with a function row, haptic trackpad, and all-new hardware design.  
• The Apple Pencil Pro introduces haptic feedback, a programmable squeeze gesture, and a "barrel roll" feature for adjusting brush/tool shape based on pencil orientation  
• Apps like Freeform and GoodNotes are being updated to support the new Apple Pencil Pro capabilities  
• Availability varies by model, and waiting for refurbished units or discounts may be beneficial

Shortcuts Corner:  
• A listener asks for a way to quickly access downtime settings on their children's Macs  
• Rosemary creates a shortcut using the Mac's System Preferences URL scheme to open the downtime settings directly  
• She recommends adding the shortcut to the Mac's menu bar for easy access  
• While it's not possible to toggle downtime automatically with a shortcut due to security concerns, this method still streamlines the process of adjusting the settings
