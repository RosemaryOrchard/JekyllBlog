<p>Rose and Scotty get to what is hopefully the last in our tragically numbered series on our coverage of the <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/">Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology</a>, which is Engage (or Do). We talk about the act of getting in to execution, using this act to prove out or improve the preceding part of the workflow, and what the mindset of doing can accomplish in terms of life and your system.</p>
