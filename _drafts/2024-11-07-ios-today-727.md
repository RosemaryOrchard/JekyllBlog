"In this episode of iOS Today, Mikah Sargent and Rosemary Orchard dive deep into the world of Apple Watch faces. They discuss how to customize and share watch faces, offer troubleshooting tips for syncing contacts and custom alert tones across devices, and share a handy shortcut for automatically changing your watch face based on your current Focus mode.

Main Topic: Apple Watch Faces  
\- Rosemary and Mikah discuss the removal of certain watch faces in watchOS 11 and share their favorite ways to customize watch faces using complications.  
\- They explain how to edit watch faces directly on the Apple Watch and offer tips for choosing the right complications based on the watch face style and complication shape.  
\- Mikah and Rosemary demonstrate how to share Apple Watch faces with others while maintaining privacy by selectively sharing complication data.

Feedback  
\- Adam from Derby, England, asks for help with syncing custom ringtones and text tones across his iPhone, iPad Pro, and iPad Mini.  
\- Mikah suggests a ""nuclear option"" involving deleting and recreating the problematic contact to force a clean sync across all devices.  
\- Rosemary advises installing custom ringtones on all devices before assigning them to contacts and cautions that large contact images may interfere with syncing.

Shortcuts Corner  
\- Rosemary shares a handy shortcut for automatically changing your Apple Watch face based on your current Focus mode.  
\- She demonstrates how to customize watch faces for different Focus modes within the Settings app on an iPhone.  
\- Rosemary suggests creating variations of the same watch face with different color schemes to visually distinguish between Focus modes without drastically changing the overall design."
