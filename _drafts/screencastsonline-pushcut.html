From simply adding options when setting a HomeKit scene, to diving all the way into the deep end with an automation server, Rose provides plenty of automation ideas to tickle your fancy. Pushcut works by sending notifications to let you run your automations. You can connect these to times or locations (or even to web services like Zapier or Integromat) to trigger shortcuts based on other events.</p>
