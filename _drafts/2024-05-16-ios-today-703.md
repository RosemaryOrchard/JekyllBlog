In [episode 703 iOS Today](https://twit.tv/shows/ios-today/episodes/703)...
In this episode of iOS Today, Mikah Sargent and Rosemary Orchard dive into the world of Safari extensions, discussing a variety of handy tools that can enhance your browsing experience on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. From content blockers to custom search engines, the duo explores the benefits and potential drawbacks of these powerful add-ons. Additionally, Rosemary tackles a Shortcuts Corner question about switching Apple Watch faces using Siri.

Safari Extensions:

*   Browser Note: A simple extension that allows you to stick virtual post-it notes on websites, reminding you of important information when you revisit the page.
*   Keyword Search: An extension that enables custom search engines for various websites, allowing you to quickly search Amazon, DuckDuckGo, and even TWiT.tv right from Safari's address bar.
*   1Blocker: A powerful content blocker that prevents ads and trackers from loading on web pages, potentially speeding up your browsing experience and protecting your privacy.
*   Redirect Web for Safari: An extension that lets you create custom redirect rules for websites, ensuring you always end up on the correct version of a site (e.g., old.reddit.com instead of www.reddit.com).
*   PayPal Honey: A controversial but money-saving extension that automatically finds and applies coupons and deals as you shop online.
*   Vinegar and Baking Soda: Two extensions that work together to improve your video watching experience by replacing the native video player controls on YouTube and other video sites with iOS's native controls.
*   Opener: While not technically a Safari extension, this app allows you to choose which app opens when you click on a link, giving you more control over your browsing experience.

Shortcuts Corner:

*   Doug asks how to switch Apple Watch faces using Siri without having to confirm the action on his watch when his iPhone is locked.
*   Rosemary walks through the process of ensuring the shortcut has the necessary permissions to run when the device is locked and troubleshoots potential issues Doug may be facing.
*   If the "Allow Running When Locked" option is missing, Rosemary suggests resetting the shortcut's privacy settings or recreating the shortcut from scratch.
