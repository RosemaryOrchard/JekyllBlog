<p><img class="alignright wp-image-4489 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/file-1.png" alt="" />This week, I produced a tip video for ScreenCastsOnline to tell you all about Peek-a-View, an app designed to let you show your photos to others, but without the risk of them deleting or sharing your images. When combined with Guided Access mode on iOS, Peek-a-View becomes a view-only photo collection that's perfect for toddlers.</p>
