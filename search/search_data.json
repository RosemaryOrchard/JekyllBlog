You could also use a group - or remove the destination components entirely to put everything in the global inbox.Copy the item link in DEVONthink so you can get the ID for Shortcuts.When you run the shortcut, it asks you for a name, you can cheat and add lots of names though (use a return to separate them), and it will run through each item.For each one, you can choose if this is a project or a task. For projects, the shortcut automatically creates a group, and for a task, you get the choice of markdown, text, or a group.The shortcut creates the DEVONthink item first, then creates the project or task in OmniFocus with a link back to the DEVONthink destination in the note.

I‚Äôve tried putting these things in OmniFocus and tagging them, using Trello (which I still use, but for different purposes) and I know there has been more than one paper planner over the years! Some of you may be asking ‚Äúwhat is a someday maybe task?‚Äù. The name comes from Getting Things Done by David Allen, the idea is something is a task or project you want to do, but you can‚Äôt work on it right now - so you put it on a list called ‚ÄúSomeday/Maybe‚Äù to get around to when the time is right. A few months ago I turned to Git to try and solve my problem. There were a few features I knew I wanted from a system:   Some interoperability with OmniFocus to make it easy to take things out as  well as put things back in, or something I could easily script.    The ability to track what changed, when, and optionally why .  The ability to tweak my system easily without rebuilding it. Automation options.- [ ] This is a sample task in the format I started with I started in Drafts, using the task format. This is nice and visual but doesn‚Äôt offer all the other features I wanted without setting up lots of actions and cobbling things together. Drafts has versions - which satisfies my want to be able to look back in time, but it lacks explicit change messages connected to these. While Drafts is the right tool for many jobs, it wasn‚Äôt quite what I was looking for here. Next, I did some digging around and stumbled across my old friends BBEdit and Textastic. These are my preferred text-based file editing apps on macOS and iOS, but alone neither of them really hit the spot - until I decided to take some lessons from the professional side of my life and use Version Control. Version Control systems are designed for programming, so you can track who changed what, when, and assuming they wrote a decent commit message to accompany the change, why. There are quite a few services out there offering these, I chose to use Git and to use GitLab for this. (That said, the sample to accompany this blog post is on GitHub because I know most people are more familiar with that!) Now, I can make a change to my Someday/Maybe lists from any device, including the web, and just type why I changed it. Version control, in this case, Git, automatically stores what changed and when. You can even do a diff, compare two files side by side so see exactly what was added or removed! Now it‚Äôs time to get into the nitty-gritty! Let‚Äôs start with the apps. As mentioned above, on macOS I use BBEdit, this has Git integration so I can theoretically do everything with that. That said, sometimes I switch up my apps so I also have SourceTree around to handle the Git stuff. I could use the command line, but I usually don‚Äôt want to. On iOS I use two apps Working Copy and Textastic. There‚Äôs good documentation on how to connect the two of them together so I won‚Äôt go into detail on that here. To be clear, I use Working Copy for the Git side of things and Textastic for the writing. Next up: Files. I have two primary lists, Someday and Maybe. Someday is ‚ÄúI really want to do this and will make time for it, but that time is not now‚Äù, whereas Maybe is ‚ÄúI like the sound of this‚Äù. Projects/tasks stay within these lists until they become unwieldy. If a project has more than 10 tasks that I want to document I create a special list for it. To keep things organised I start these file names with an underscore (_) and then add a note below the task to see that file. Finally: Format. This took a while to nail down. As I mentioned I started in Drafts so as of when I recorded an episode of Nested Folders 11: Someday/Maybe/Never I was still using - [ ] to indicate a task. This does give you the look of pretty checkboxes - but the point of your Someday/Maybe list isn‚Äôt to keep of what you have done, but what you want to do. This means I would never check the tasks off. Instead, I‚Äôve changed to just Taskpaper (at least the elements that OmniFocus uses) as this allows me to copy items over directly when I am ready to do so, and also to export easily. Now I can update my someday/maybe list whenever I like, across devices, and see what I changed, and when.

Making a packing list is great fun, until you forget something so in this episode of Automators David and I decided to find as many ways as we could to solve the problem of creating a packing list. Naturally our techniques overlapped in a few places, but we still came up with a variety of solutions - which you can use to solve other problems too. I've documented most of the Shortcuts in the show notes for this episode, but my Drafts action group (and accompanying Shortcut) need a little more space - so let's dive in! First of all, no matter how organised I might be I still need a task in my task management system to actually do the packing, so I kick off my process with a Shortcut, it looks through my calendar for all day events, I choose one of them, and then it creates a new Draft (tagged with packing) before adding a task to OmniFocus with the title \"Pack\", a due date of the start date of the trip, and a link to my Draft in the note. You can download the Shortcut here: Create Packing List (Drafts &amp; OF) Now let's look at my Drafts action group, this has 8 actions (I've expanded a little since recording). Manage Template List This gets you started with creating your basic lists if you don't have them yet - you choose categories (it suggests Clothes, Toiletries, and Technology), and then set the emoji for each category before adding items to it. If you already have a list you get 4 choices:   Add category - Asks you for the name of the category, an emoji to represent  it, and items to add to it.    Update Emoji - Shows you all your categories and the emojis associated with  them for editing.  Delete Category - Gives you a choice of categories to delete.   Manage Category Items - Allows you to add or remove items in a category as  well as correct spelling.  None of these actions affect anything in any of your packing list - maybe someday I'll get to it, but not yet.Tips:   To find emoji quickly use Emojipedia,  it has a great search and you can copy the emoji with just a tap.    Add a üîã emoji after anything that needs charging - I have a few actions to  help you keep track of those. Tag Packing List This just adds the tag \"packing\" to your Draft so you can filter for these quickly.Add Packing Items to List This shows you a prompt with a list of your categories, you tap a category, deselect items within that category you do not wish to include (I assumed that you'll likely want all items in a category), and the items are added to your list. After this it runs the action \"Sort Packing Items\" automatically.Sort Packing Items You might be wondering why I'm bothering to assign emoji to my categories - aside from \"they're cute\". It's simple: Emoji are sortable. So everything with a üëñ tag is grouped together. This way I can both visually identify items in a category, and the sort action (which is alphabetical) groups them together. All the items are in the task format in Drafts, this looks something like this:- [ ] üëñ Jeans- [x] üëñ TShirt- [ ] üõÄ Shampoo Tapping on one of the [ ] boxes checks it off ([x]) or unchecks it. The x is sorted below the space so unchecked items stay at the top.Uncheck All I like to reuse my packing list on the way home to make sure I don't forget anything and that everything is charged, this unchecks everything, resets charging icons, and sorts the list again for me.What should I charge? Maybe I travel with too much tech, but I do travel with a lot and most of it needs charging - after all, what good is a battery pack that isn't charged? Everything that needs charging has a üîã icon at the end of it, this action grabs all of those items and shows them to me, selecting one replaces the battery with a üîå emoji, so I can see it is ready.Charge For items that you add outside of your list you may wish to add the battery emoji, instead of hunting though your keyboard for it use this action. It will also replace the battery with a plug or vice versa.Delete ItemThis just deletes the current row in Drafts. This all works with scripts in Drafts, I can't guarantee it will work perfectly so I would love to hear your feedback!

When I was at MacStock not only did I have a great time but I spent some time making Shortcuts! Shortly after my deeper dive talk I got a chance to chat to an Automators fan, Bodie Quirk, who showed me his setup for playing entire albums from certain artists. Everything he had was working, but it was getting difficult to maintain (something that will probably happen to everyone at some point or another!). The challenge intrigued me, so I sat there for a while with an iOS 12 iPad and keyboard and poked at the problem. It took a few attempts (Bodie said he could see my brain working, what a compliment!), but I ended up with three Shortcuts which can do everything, and will do all the maintenance themselves! These Shortcuts are based on files saved in iCloud, you could save them in Dropbox if you prefer but they're only text files so won't take up much space. Shortcut #1 maintains our lists of artists - this file is used in Shortcut #2 as well to help maintain the album lists. Album Chooser Artists    Create Folder - this is necessary for the other steps to work,  and once the folder has been created it will just continue on with life as  normal.    Get File - this checks for the current artists file. It  specifically doesn't throw an error if it's not found because then when you  run the Shortcut for the first time (or if you've deleted the file for some  reason) then you can create it with this step.    Get Text from Input - grabs the contents of our artists list if  there is one    Text - here we put the content of the current artists list and  Ask When Run, the Text action with Ask When Run is  bigger than the ask for input button so its ideal here.    Save File - save our list of artists where the next Shortcut  can grab them.  Update Artist Albums  This Shortcut starts by setting a variable to nothing so that we have an empty list of albums. Then it grabs the lists of artists (maintained by the previous Shortcut, if it doesn't find it run the first Shortcut), and gives them to you as a list of artists to choose from. Then once you have chosen an artist it finds all the music where the artist is your chosen artist and gets the album name and if it doesn't have that album name in the list yet then it adds it. This is the part of the Shortcut that make take a long time to run if you have a prolific artist. Then it grabs the list of albums and saves them into a file with the name of the artist. If you want to be able to exclude albums then add a Choose from List action between Get Variable: Albums and Combine Text and make sure it's set to Allow Multiple (I'd also recommend checking all the albums by default). Play Album By Artist  This is the Shortcut which you would use most of the time - the one that lives in your widget and with a few taps will play the album of your choice. It starts by grabbing a list of all the album files from our last Shortcut, this way even if you added a new artist if you didn't run the Shortcut yet to get their albums you won't run into an error. After you've picked your artists it uses the contents of the file to show you a list of the albums by that artist, it grabs the music from that album sorted by track number and then plays it.

All opinions below are entirely my own.You may recall that recently I reviewed my Waterfield Staad backpack which is a lovely backpack that I use a lot of the time. However there are times when I need to carry more than fits in this bag - trips where I'm away overnight or just need to carry a lot of things. When the chance came up to review a new Tom Bihn bag with a dedicated laptop compartment, clamshell opening and luggage pass through it seemed meant to be - and this was confirmed by the random number generator saying I won!I'll start with some background. The Synik is based on another Tom Bihn bag, the Synapse. That one doesn't have a clamshell opening, dedicated laptop compartment, side opening, or luggage pass through - it's a great bag but honestly not one I would buy for myself. It comes in two sizes (19L and 25L), and according to everyone I know who has one it's an amazing bag. There are two sizes of the Synik, 22L and 30L, the idea was that enough space was added to the Synapse to make space for the dedicated laptop compartment and also to allow for full use of the clamshell opening. The straps on the Synik are also different - they're edgeless straps which means there are no seams touching your shoulders. Day to day I've not really noticed a massive benefit, but I'm sure if I loaded the bag up with heavy items that could cause the straps to dig in I would!For those of you who aren't familiar with Tom Bihn bags there's some important facts you might like to know:They're made in the USA in Seattle.All of their bags have a variety of colour options available, including different internal colours.Bags have O-rings, this allows you to clip things to your bag so you can pull them out without losing them or find them without digging around (my keys are on a long strap, my sunglasses are in a pouch which keeps them close to the top, etc.)There's a wide array of accessories which you can purchase to go with your bag, including the above mentioned keystrap and sunglasses pouch (a small Ghost Whale for the curious).I picked the 22L to review, and was fortunate to get my preferred colour choice: Aubergine and Northwest Sky. The Aubergine is a thick rugged material, whereas the Northwest Sky is rather more flexble and great as an interior. There are choices for the outside material - I'd recommend checking the Tom Bihn site for the ins and outs of each one.The bag has one main compartment, through which you can access the laptop compartment from the top. The laptop compartment can also be accessed from the outside, the outside zip isn't the full height of the laptop instead you push it in diagonally and then straighten the laptop up inside the pocket. It sounds complicated but in my experience many laptop pockets with external access work this way and it only takes one attempt to get the hang of it.This is a great bag for what I need, I used it at MacStock and aside from a few times when I forgot which pocket I'd put something in (I can do that even when I'm having an amazing day so don't blame the bag!) it worked perfectly. I put a Mac Mini inside in the box and carried it around (when Stephen Hackett sort of volunteered to upgrade the RAM in my Mac Mini I couldn't say no!).There are several things I really love about this bag:The water bottle pocket is in the center, this means that I won't end up weighed down on one side.The front pockets pack inside the bag, instead of bulging outwards.The front bottom pocket might look small but it fits my Nintendo Switch easily.The clamshell opening means I can also just open the side of my bag and reach in to grab something (assuming I remember where I put it), and I can of course open up the whole bag.It's not too large, I got away with it as my personal item flying home - the 30L would have looked large though and I might not have been so lucky.The laptop is suspended in the bag, so when you put it down it's not likely to hit the floor.There's a system where you can attach a \"cache\" (Tom Bihn's device sleeve) to the opposite side of the main pocket - I bought one for my 11\" iPad Pro and it's wonderful.I can put it on the handle of my trolley case when in airport lounges, on airport buses, etc. (Did I mention I fly a lot?)There is one thing I've run into which I'm not a huge fan of: when the zippers are fully open you need use both hands to close the bag, pushing the chunky weatherproof zipper around that corner is hard.The bag also comes with a removeable framesheet so you can make it lighter if you don't need as much structure. The framesheet is what suspends the laptop so I've only taken it out to try, it wasn't the easiest to get out but it's also not likely you'll be doing this on a regular basis.So far this bag has only been on one adventure with me, but it will be coming to San Francisco later this month for a more extensive trial!As I don't have a Synapse to compare it to I borrowed some at MacStock for the comparison pictures below. This bag is sized exactly between the two models, but at a glance it looks more like the 19L - and that is what it is based on!I'm definitely very happy with this bag and can't wait to keep using it - now I need to plan more travel![gallery ids=\"3621,3620,3615,3619,3606,3614,3611,3610,3609,3618,3608,3617,3607,3616,3605,3613,3594,3595,3586,3596,3585,3588,3590,3589,3591,3592,3593,3612\" type=\"thumbnails\" link=\"file\" size=\"large\"]&nbsp;","url":"/blog/review-tom-bihn-synik/","excerpt":"<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>Disclaimer: Tom Bihn provided this bag free for a review.

Photo Magic: Adam has an amazing setup whereby photos taken on his DSLR end up  automatically sent to him via iMessage, added to Photos, uploaded to Google  Photos, oh, and the RAW photos are uploaded to Amazon too. Sounds crazy?  There's a bunch of very good reasons for this!    The Dark Dungeon Text Adventure: Did you know you can play a text adventure game in Shortcuts? Or have it  translated into (almost) any language? Adam made it easy! For more details you'll have to listen to the show. As a note, in the show I said I thought you could get a public link to a Dropbox folder through Shortcuts.

Timery has excellent integrations with Shortcuts, letting me start and stop timers as part of my automations without thinking. Whenever I run Shortcuts to put myself into certain modes (such as podcasting, or writing for my blog), as well as launching the correct applications, I also start logging my time. I also build in checks to let me know how long I‚Äôve already worked on projects today when I end my timers - this is a not so gentle nudge that if I want to achieve my goals, I should invest an appropriate amount of time in them!  The main screen in Timers is your saved timers which serve three purposes, letting you start tracking a project, with tags and a description if you so choose, with just a tap. These timers are also donated to Siri (and therefore Shortcuts), and also display how long you‚Äôve worked on those timers today. I find this screen great for both a quick overview as well as starting timers.  The next screen is Time Entries where you can see log of your most recent time entries. There are swipe options for these entries allowing you to delete or edit them, as well as play button which lets you start a new time tracking entry with the same parameters.  The developer behind Timery, Joe Hribar, has worked extremely hard to make sure this app rivals the Toggl app - it has all the core functionality covered, as well as genuinely excellent shortcuts support. This means there‚Äôs full support for Workspaces, the premium Toggl feature which lets you helps you carve up your life further with tags and projects belonging to Workspaces.  The way I use Timery most, is through Shortcuts. I use Launch Center Pro and Pushcuts to send me notifications which I use to launch Shortcuts, and these shortcuts tell Timery to track my time for me. As all the saved timers can be used to both start timers as well as check the time logged so far on each of them this alone becomes helpful for tracking time. The Shortcuts support allows you to toggle ‚Äúshow when run‚Äù (this is the only setting on all donated shortcuts within the Shortcuts app right now) - this is used to show you the details of your time tracking, and it‚Äôs done in a minimalist way which makes sure I see the information I need and can dismiss the notification within a second or two at most. As well as the saved timers in the app, you can also just start time tracking and add the details you want or need - which makes it easy to get going and then you can give it a title, project, or tags later before you finish (or after the fact with the Timery club).Timery Club The Timery app in its free state is excellent, but if you join the Timery Club, an optional in app subscription of $9.99/year, as well as supporting development of the app you get extra functionality:   Unlimited saved timers, the free version allows you to have 4 saved timers  (which in my opinion is a generous number).    Edit all the elements of time entries from the last week as well as delete  and duplicate them.  Add historical time entries. Add, edit, and delete Toggl projects, tasks, and tags.   Show your tag names in the saved timers (otherwise the tag icon is  displayed)    Custom themes, app icons, and dark mode. Dark mode can be toggled based on  the screen brightness, sunrise, and sunset, or manually.   If you have no interest in tracking your time then this app is not for you, but if you‚Äôre curious about it, or have been struggling with it - or even if you already track every second and want to make your life easier, I highly recommend downloading Timery. It has made it much easier for me to track my time, because it is very simple to use - and in my case, it builds right into my shortcuts that I already use to launch a significant number of actions. Timery feels like a much better-designed app than the Toggl app, there‚Äôs more data on the screen, and I can choose what data goes on what screen - as well as the Shortcuts that should be donated (instead of doing the action and letting it show up and then having lots of unnecessary actions in my Shortcuts app. Plus the developer is active and open to feedback and suggestions for improvement! Timery is available on the App Store today, it‚Äôs a free download with an optional in app purchase for the Timery Club which is $0.99/month or $9.99/year.","url":"/blog/timery-the-toggl-app-has-landed/","excerpt":"<p>\n  <img\n    class=\"alignright wp-image-2819 size-thumbnail\"\n    src=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/Image-3-150x150.png\"\n    alt=\"\"\n    width=\"150\"\n    height=\"150\"\n  /><br />\n  David Sparks and I teased it on Automators back in\n  <a href=\"https://relay.fm/automators/17\">episode 17</a>, and now the app is\n  here: <a href=\"https://timeryapp.com\">Timery</a>, the Toggl app we all wish\n  Toggl had made! the\n</p>\n"},{"id":"blog-review-waterfield-staad-backpack-slim","title":"Review: Waterfield Staad Backpack (Slim)","categories":null,"tags":["Bag","Review","Travel"],"content":"When I was in Chicago for MPU Live in March I took the opportunity to order a Waterfield Staad backpack to my hotel to bring back with me. I'd been intrigued by their bags for quite some time, but after seeing MacGenie with one of these at PodCon, and seeing MacSparky's Sling bag at the same event, I was convinced I wanted the bag.Let's start with logistics: I realised only shortly before my trip that this would be a great time to get the bag, so I paid for premium shipping, contacted Gary through the contact address on their web page, and hoped for the best - and they delivered (with time to spare)! After collecting it from the Fedex in my hotel (still cheaper than international shipping I would note), I actually got my hands on it.I picked the black ballistic with the chocolate leather, I'm a fan of the Indiana Jones look - but I like my bags to look pristine for as long as possible and knew the ballistic fabric would deliver that, however leather ages whatever you do - so the chocolate was an obvious choice to let me still see the wear on it! The inside of the flap is lined with smooth black leather, and this doesn't mark easily so I suspect the completely black model wouldn't have either.Some background: I fly, a lot. I'm writing this review on my 5th flight this month, which happens to be my 3rd weekend on the road (or in the air) in a row. Next weekend I'm not going anywhere (at least that I know of), and then I'm off to WWDC which involves 4 flights. I fly carry on only whenever I can, because it's cheaper, and it means I know my things will be with me when I land. However this means my backpack is restricted to some pretty small dimensions - unless I wanted to put everything in my backpack (which if you've queued in the immigration line at LAX before you will probably agree is not fun). So I need a small backpack, I also want to be able to get at everything pretty easily - without said items falling out of the bag if I open it up.This bag is perfect for me as it has a laptop sleeve which fits my 13\" MacBook Air like it was made for it (it's actually made for the 13\" MacBook Pro which is cuboid rather than wedge shaped), and another sleeve on the front of that for my 11\" iPad Pro in the smart folio with the Apple Pencil. On the inside of the bag at the top there are two vertical pockets which close with Velcro - I use one for my passport and one for my charger and USB C cables (to USB C and Lightning). On the front at the bottom you have two pockets as well - these are designed so that if you swing the bag up under your arm they face up (or completely down if you open the opposite side pocket), which is where my purse (American: wallet), AirPods, any medication I need, lip balm, tissues, etc., live. If I'm taking the bag to work my work ID/access card go in there too.Everything else goes in the main compartment in front of my iPad Pro - this usually includes things like my Bose headphones in their case (I prefer to fly with the QC35s, but sometimes take the QC30s instead), Nintendo Switch, etc. Overfilling the bag isn't an option because then the flap wouldn't close - but this helps me limit what I'm carrying and I appreciate that.I was impressed with this bag when I first got it in March, but 2 months later I can see it's truly holding up as it ought to - it looks great, and it works. Because of the sleeves for my devices (which aren't insanely large as they often are in bags) I can just slip my laptop and iPad in and out, the half zip on the front under the flap lets me get access to things inside if I need to, but keeps things securely in place. The clasp is very good too - it closes easily (unless you try to overstuff the bag), and it stays put. The fabric is also exactly wide enough that you can slip a pin on it for decoration without worrying about damage or impaired function. The bag also fits nicely on my frame - the Stout model is unsurprisingly larger, which is one reason why I didn't order it (if I have space in a bag I will absolutely throw things in \"just in case\" and then end up regretting lugging said items around later) - and I'm 5'7\" as well as pretty slim. I'm also really pleased with the padding on the straps and the back of the bag (pictured below), they're thick and comfortable, but not so thick that the bad becomes bulky.The only thing that remains to be seen is if the iPad pocket will fit my iPad Pro with the Brydge keyboard attached - however that is something I'll have to wait another week or so to try! I'm very pleased with my bag - and now I have to admit I'm very tempted to try out some of their other products like one of their cases for the Nintendo Switch!","url":"/blog/review-waterfield-staad-backpack-slim/","excerpt":"<p>When I was in Chicago for <a href=\"https://relay.fm/mpu/472\">MPU Live</a> in March I took the opportunity to order a <a href=\"https://www.sfbags.com/collections/laptop-backpacks/products/staad-laptop-backpack\">Waterfield Staad backpack</a> to my hotel to bring back with me.

I've been using PushBullet and Pushover to do this - I've tried both and they're both good, but they're designed for notifications and the URLs triggering automations is not something it was designed to do. Additionally PushBullet still hasn't been updated for the iPhone X(s) screen format. Pushover has been updated more recently, but it still doesn't quite match up with what Pushcut can do as a dedicated app.Let's start by looking at a few use cases for this:   MacSparky and I take it in turns to post the Automators episodes, that means  every second episode when it releases I need to be prompted to put up my  blog post about the episode. That post is prepared, and is in Drafts, so  once the episode is up I get a notification that triggers a Shortcut to help  me find the right Draft and post it.    When an article of mine goes up on The Sweet Setup I like to go and clean it  out of my Dropbox (where the drafts sit), which I do through a Shortcut, and  then post about it on my site.  Those are just two of the many use cases I have for this sort of thing, in each case there can be multiple steps I would like to execute on my device - some of these I've combined into a single Shortcut which runs those other shortcuts, but others I'm still trying to rely on my memory (which has more holes in it than a sieve!). Also if I want or need to change these I need to log into Zapier and change the URL scheme that's in the URL part of the notification action step (whether that's through Pushover or Pushbullet). Pushcut is a free app with two subscription levels, I'll give you a quick overview of those:   Free: Create three notifications, which can each trigger  one action (opening a URL or running a Shortcut).    Basic: Create as many notifications as you want, with as  many actions as you want on each notification. Plus you can sync these  between your devices.    Pro: Dynamic notifications - based on JSON you use to  trigger the notification which can give you: inputs for Shortcuts and  dynamic title and text in notifications. You can also target individual  devices.  I immediately decided I wanted the Pro - I've been passing variables to Shortcuts as parameters through Zapier, and I've been building my own workarounds for branching to give me different information. Most people should start out with the free level and then try basic though to get to grips with the system.Setup  The first thing to do is to create a notification in the Pushcut app, and give it a name. The name of the in the app is separate to what appears as the title of the notification which is very useful allowing you to have useful internal descriptions, but have an action based title. The title gets URL encoded and becomes part of the URL you POST to in order to trigger the notification. Tapping this URL will copy it to your clipboard - and I'll come back to what to do with that near the end!  Secondly you want to set the Notification Title and Description. These are what will show up on your device when you get the notification, I like mine to tell me what to do, and why I'm doing it - this way I won't just ignore the notifications because the seem irrelevant. After this you should set a default action, and you probably want to add this as action as well. The default action is what happens if you just tap on the notification, or swipe on it from the lock screen, and the actions are what you (can) trigger after force touching the notification - you can add multiple actions to a notification here, giving you a choice in which action to execute.  Now we have the basics set up we can trigger the notification! Depending on your needs you could use this with something like IFTTT or Zapier's web hooks, or even build it into a script somewhere.  Now whenever this is triggered you will get a notification sent to your device which when opened will trigger a Shortcut.  In addition to what I've outlined above you can enhance this with the Pro options - allowing you to specify custom notification titles and content, and also pass input to your shortcuts. You can also run URL schemes allowing you to something like add a task to Due - without having to go via Shortcuts. I've been fortunate enough to talk to the developer of Pushcut over the last few weeks and he's been adding enhancements right and left! While the app and service are already a step up from existing solutions just because of the ease of use, the fact that this is a dedicated service for triggering automations on iOS means it really is well thought out.

In the last year the app has increased in power so much, as well as gaining a Mac app, and now seemed like the perfect time to cover it. Today I thought I'd share a few bonus tips that were mentioned in the episode but not completely covered, starting with the Apple Watch component.  In Drafts on the iPhone paired to your Apple Watch you can control some bonus settings. First of all you can enable auto-capture - this means when you open Drafts on your Apple Watch (such as from a complication) it will start listening for dictation - so you just open the app and start talking. You can also enable showing the inbox count, which is the number of Drafts in your inbox. The final extra setting is giving everything from your Apple Watch a default tag - mine is called Apple Watch (iOS and macOS automatically capitalise it, but drafts only uses lowercase tags to help you avoid duplicates). As I mentioned on the show, automatically tagging everything from your watch can be a useful indicator that your Draft might not be 100% what you said, but rather what the dictation engine thought you said.  Something I realised not too long ago was that you can associate action groups with workspaces. A workspace is a saved filter of tags and/or a search term, and an action group is a group of actions - the one above the keyboard row, and the one in the pop out menu (which can be pinned open on larger devices) on the right hand side. In the bottom of the settings for the Workspace you can specify which action groups should be assigned to the keyboard row and the action pop out - so when you switch workspaces the rest of the app can switch too.  Drafts is a very powerful app - so much so that it's replaced many other apps for me, I hope you enjoy the episode!

I've been showing this as we progress throughout a meeting with MindNode, so we start the meeting with the centre point, or main node, and progress from there. This means as people are discussing ideas I can reflect it visually on the whiteboard, and I have a pretty graphic to send them afterwards! The enhanced presentation mode in MindNode 6 has been very helpful for this, letting me show off notes that I've made on areas, or even to lock the view while I zoom in on something else and tweak a spelling mistake.A few features of MindNode 6 have been game changers though - first of all, multi select. You can do this with a finger or an Apple Pencil - and it's exactly what it sounds like, letting you select multiple nodes. You can then move them all, copy them, or do whatever you want or need to do with them.I also love how you can search for stickers, the team was smart and assigned multiple keywords to each sticker - so searching for \"sign\" gets me, among other things, the warning sign - as does searching for \"warning\"!Another way I use MindNode is to give me a good overview of projects, the folding and unfolding of nodes comes in handy here, allowing me to zoom in and out as needed. Add to this the new ability to hide connections and I have a great way of looking at everything, or just the key areas - helped by the focus feature which lets me fade out everything else. I love the ability to switch to outline view too - while I tend to prefer visuals, sometimes you just need a list - like when you've planned out a packing list! Being able to switch to the outline view also shows me things from a new perspective - which often helps me to fill in gaps in my plans.It's hard to describe use cases for MindNode unless you've previously used a mind mapping application - but when you need to structure keywords, and text it's a great place to start.MindNode 6 is out now and is a free upgrade for all MindNode 5 users.

This wasn't a great system though, Time There is really for planning things in the next few days so going beyond that involves a lot of scrolling, and Klok means you need to calculate everything yourself. I use Fantastical as my calendar and that has timezone support too - so you can add an event at 8am San Francisco time and it shows up at 5pm Vienna time, but this works after you've planned the event, still leaving you with the task of figuring out the when which is the most difficult part.Enter CalZones - by David Smith, maker of Sleep++, Workouts++ and Activity++. He is familiar with the problem I and many others face - and decided to make the app for us! CalZones starts by giving me a month overview of my calendar, I tend not to have too many appointments in one day, and the coloured dots below each date indicate how many events I have and which calendar they are on.In the app settings, you can configure your timezones and for each time zone, you can give it a custom name and an abbreviation. This means that I can call SoCal time \"David\", but central time \"Stephen\" so I can skip that mental overhead of remembering who is in which timezone. These timezones then show up as a vertical scroller when creating and editing events, letting me see the time selected for all of my favourite timezones. These timezones also show up in the widget, with your preferred names, giving you a quick reference as to what time it is where - or in my case, for whom! The expanded widget shows you these in a linear fashion, and tapping on a time in the future jumps you straight to the event creation page for that time.Along with specifying your time zones you can also control which calendars you see, your preferred theme and icon, work day times, week start, and how event times should be displayed. The latter is very useful allowing you to see that the event you're looking at starts at 7pm local time, but 10am in the organisers time.The daily calendar view is where your chosen colour theme comes into play. It highlights working hours (set in your preferences), then non-working hours before midnight, and then the hours after midnight until the working day starts - in three colours. This lets you see how hospitable the time is to your fellow participants, and helps you avoid scheduling something at 3am instead of 3pm by accident.In the few weeks I've been using this app it's been indispensable - and it earned a spot on my home screen within just a few hours. For people who never deal with timezones, this app might not be for you, but it's a solid app and those of us who need something like this are very grateful for its existence!CalZones is available on the App Store today for $4.99.You can find out more on David Smith's blog.","url":"/blog/calzones-release/","excerpt":"<p><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-2379 alignright\" src=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/04/CalZones-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />A lot of things in my life involve working around time zones - David Sparks lives in California, so when organising a time to podcast with him that's a 9 hour difference, add a podcast guest and unless they're in the same time as one of us, you have a headache!</p>\n"},{"id":"blog-how-i-use-drafts-on-iphone-macos-and-apple-watch","title":"How I Use Drafts on iPhone, macOS, and Apple Watch","categories":null,"tags":[],"content":"Lots of people ask me how and why I use Drafts, and the answer, in a nutshell, is I use it for almost everything because it works very well for me.

You may have heard him on a few other podcasts, including Mac Power Users. We dug into getting started with HyperCard and HyperTalk - back when those were available, these were created by Bill Atkinson - and there's a story about him having to submit the number of lines of code he wrote when he was working on QuickDraw that made me smile! Nowadays Dr Drang mostly using Python to program his automations - with a dose of AppleScript and Keyboard Maestro to get certain information. Regular Expressions are something we talked about in depth, they're hard to explain - let alone on a podcast, but as David said - they're essentially a special language for searching. One thing I forgot to say on the podcast was that regular expressions can and do vary between languages - but the basic rules stay the same which makes things easier! If you want to get started with Regular Expressions then Regex 101 is a pretty good place to get started - you can input plenty of sample text and it highlights what you've matched as you go, as well as explaining your expressions and having the quick expressions area in the bottom right-hand corner. Another thing we talked about are things you don't necessarily want to complete to automate - such as sending invoice emails or creating the harsher reminder email to pay an overdue invoice. This is something well worth keeping in mind when creating automations - even if you can automate it the whole way through, it's good to have some human intervention in some areas. And in some places, you can't automate things - such as adding a repeat to a reminder, so you need to step in and do something. Local weather is something lots of people want! And while Weather Underground has shut down you can still use Dark Sky's API if you want to program your own solution, and for an \"out of the box\" solution you could use Netatmo and Carrot weather - I do both of these! Drafts is one of my favourite applications ever and it was great to hear Drang break down his blogging workflow and how it makes use of the great automation features available to us in the app. The Drafts Action Directory is an excellent resource and all of the actions there can be installed whether or not you're a pro user of the app.  One tip I talked about in regards to Shortcuts is checking if input is present - and I have a fairly standard setup I use to handle this: * Count Items * If equals zero * Get photos/files - depending on what you want * Else: get the input provided to the shortcut. This means that when I run my shortcuts from the widget screen, Drafts, Launch Center Pro, or directly within Shortcuts, I don't get confused when it doesn't work. It was excellent to have Dr. Drang on the show, and I hope you enjoy the episode!Thank you to Luna Display and TextExpander for sponsoring this episode.

My first impression after opening the Anker box is that this cable is thick, when compared side by side with an Apple cable it isn't that much thicker though - just enough to give one a feeling of solidity, I plan to keep this cable in my on the go cable bag and am confident it won't be as susceptible to the kinks that inevitably happen with thinner cables.¬†As with all Anker cables, it comes with a nice cable tidy on the cable - as these attach to the cable with a mini loop they don't go missing easily, and that means that with my always on the go everywhere lifestyle my cables are more likely to stay wrangled.  The cable works like you would expect it to work, I plugged the USB C end into my MacBook Air charger, and the other into my iPhone Xs Max with the battery pack attached, I did not try to measure the speed scientifically, but it felt like it charged just as fast as the Apple USB C cable which is what is most important for me! I also used it this morning to pair my Magic Keyboard to my MacBook Air - and as expected, it worked fine!  What I do like about this cable is the rounded corners and moulding where the connectors connect to the cable - these are less likely to snag on things, and combined with the thicker casing on the cable itself also increases its lifetime for people who bend their cables near the connectors. We all know someone who abuses cables and probably internally wince when they do so to ours! Anker's Lightning to USB C cable is definitely well made, and with it being cheaper than the Apple version I'd wholeheartedly recommend it instead if you're in the market for a cable that can connect your Mac to your iPhone, AirPods, or new iPad (aside from the latest Pro models) directly.Thanks to Anker for sending me this cable to review!","url":"/blog/anker-lightning-usb-c-cable-review/","excerpt":"<p>\n  <img class=\"wp-image-2273 aligncenter u-featured\" src=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/04/IMG_1290-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\"\n  height=\"347\" />Anker recently released a USB C to lightning cable, and while\n  there are dozens of USB A to lightning cables out there, USB C cables which\n  are approved for iPhone are new.\n</p>\n"},{"id":"blog-how-to-set-up-and-use-hot-corners-on-macos","title":"How to Set Up and Use Hot Corners on macOS","categories":null,"tags":[],"content":"The hot corners on my Mac are something I use all the time without thinking about it, how are yours configured?Read it on The Sweet Setup","url":"/blog/how-to-set-up-and-use-hot-corners-on-macos/","excerpt":"<p>The hot corners on my Mac are something I use all the time without thinking about it, how are yours configured?</p>\n"},{"id":"blog-how-to-change-your-lock-screen-information-on-macos","title":"How to Change Your Lock Screen Information on macOS","categories":null,"tags":[],"content":"If you lost your Mac, would someone know how to return it to you?

David has recently updated his Siri Shortcuts Field Guide, and if you listen to the podcast there's a discount code you can use to get a $10 discount - he's added a lot of videos which are great!https://youtu.be/Hlw0f_yRKRM In the episode I talked about my backup and restore setup for Shortcuts - the thing that saved me when I \"lost\" hundreds of Shortcuts! First of all, you can find out how many shortcuts you have with this Shortcut: Count &amp; List Shortcuts. It explicitly ignores any untitled shortcuts - as those are ones which I created once to use and haven't got around to deleting. The next step is toBackup Shortcuts - I chose to do this as an archive, because it simplifies the process in the next shortcut - Install Missing Shortcut. Even if you aren't having problems with your Shortcuts it never hurts to back them up, this way if you like me get stuck in a corner due to betas then you can uninstall and reinstall with no qualms.https://youtu.be/zWs6EiPTwwo When we were talking about the 2.2 update and what it will bring to Notes, I mentioned you could use a shortcut to handle the possibility of multiple notes - in fact you can use one Shortcut to handle this possibility with anything. Handle Multiple is a mini shortcut which lets you handle possible multiple inputs - if it just has one, be that a note, file, contact, or indeed anything, it returns it, otherwise it lets you choose and returns the chosen item. It's quite clever that you can provide input to a shortcut without it needing to be able to accept it - this keeps it out of your share sheet. To set this up though I did enable that to use the magic variables for Shortcut Input, and then I turned it off again. Automators Episode 19: Shortcuts Updates","url":"/blog/automators-19-shortcuts-updates/","excerpt":"<p>\n  In episode 19 of Automators David and I dive into recent updates to Shortcuts.\n</p>\n"},{"id":"blog-my-wishes-for-ios-13","title":"My Wishes for iOS 13","categories":null,"tags":[],"content":"Apparently it's the season where everyone speculates on what might be coming at WWDC, while I'm personally hoping for new iMacs on the hardware front, there's a few things that I could see benefitting us on the software front, so just in case Craig's reading - I've been on my best behaviour this year ;).I should note that these are in no particular order, other than that it seemed logical at the time and in many cases this was the order things occurred to me.Picture In PictureI love Picture in Picture. More often than not on a plane you'll see me using my iPad in split screen with Drafts and DevonThink or Dash on the other side of my screen, and picture in picture moving from corner to corner. The problem is I have to keep moving the picture so I can see the information I'm looking for. I would love it if it could take the bottom third of the screen when doing the big small app split, or a bottom quarter when doing a 50/50 split.Better Downtime ControlsI love Downtime, but it's turned off on my devices most of the time. This is because I have an irregular schedule - sometimes I get up at 3am to record Podcasts, and other times it's just very early for flights (it doesn't handle timezone changes too well either). I would love to be able to set multiple downtime modes, and assign them to different times of the day (layering on top of one another) - ban myself from accessing my work apps after work, and disable it for one day when I need to. I'd also love to be able to control it via the control center, Siri, and Shortcuts - turning on one of my Downtime modes. You can already customise which days you enable it on and for which times on those days - this is an excellent start, let's take it up a notch.More multi tasking3 Apps at OnceI would love to be able to see 3 apps at once properly, now I don't always need this - but for people with a 12.9\" iPad I can see this coming in handy, being able to see a PDF and Safari for reference, plus the document you're writing. This might never make it to any other devices, and I could live with that (despite having a 11\" iPad Pro), but this would be great for those the times when you need it.Two versions of the same appWord is an application I don't particularly enjoy using, but I get a fair number of documents in Word format, trying to compare those, or reference one and edit the other is an exercise in frustration. More and more apps are building their own version of split view, but if iOS could offer the framework to open multiple instances of the app at once, that would be a great help - sliding one over the other with slideover would be very useful. I presume iOS would prevent users from opening two instances of one document. Shortcuts UpdatesNow we've had Shortcuts for a good amount of time and I've had a good chance to play with it, there are still a few things I would wish for. These are mostly related to making things more Siriable - so I wouldn't need to interact with the device physically after having triggered a shortcut via Siri. Ask for InputAsk for Input is a really powerful action, if this could be transformed into Siri reading the hint/question, and dictation working as the response that would be extremely useful - I would only expect this to happen when the Shortcut was run through Siri, and the dictation would have to figure out how to stop itself (perhaps just use the standard dictation action which ends on a pause/after a not too long a period of time?) - but this would allow many automations to become hands and eyes free. The problem with current approach is you must decide if you will run this shortcut via voice, or directly from Shortcuts/the widget and prefer to type. It would be very useful if this could be dynamic. Full Screen Text ActionThere are times when we use the Text action for much more than it was intended, and this can mean that we have virtual novels in there. The problem with the text box is that it never adapts to the contents, so you are limited to the few lines and whatever the width of your device allows. I would love to see a feature where if you tap into a text box it expands to fill the screen allowing you to edit to your heart's content.Choose from Menus &amp; Lists through VoiceEveryone has been stuck in a phone tree at some point in their life, \"Press 1 to talk to sales, press 2 to request a statement, press 3 if you hope to talk to a person sometime today\" (no offence to sales, but they always seem to have about 500 more levels of phone tree inside of their options!). This isn't perfect, but it's familiar and it works. This goes back to running a Shortcut via Siri though, if there's a menu or a list you have to tap to pick an option - being able to do that via voice in some way or another would be amazing. Being able to choose one of a number of options through voice would make running many of my existing shortcuts through Siri easier - and I would run them more on my HomePod.Unset VariablesSometimes you just need variables for a short amount of time. Magic variables are fabulous - but not always what you want (and especially if you're restructuring things you had already made without magic variables - though that's becoming less and less of an issue with time, you might not have used them). What I would like is an additional action to unset a variable - so after that is done it no longer shows up in the list of variables, and no longer has any content. This would mostly make life easier when reworking longer automations, and for people not used to Shortcuts yet. It would also let you immediately see below that action where the Variable has been used - assuming it turns red like magic variables do when you delete the action that creates them.Define Your Own FunctionYou can run a Shortcut inside a Shortcut, which is then just like a function. I now have numerous Shortcuts in my library which are only ever run as a function - I would love to see the option to mark these as such, so they never show up in my share sheet, and perhaps allow me to filter quickly for these when I'm editing a \"Run Shortcut\" action.OrganisationSpeaking of filtering - please for the love of Clarus, let us organise our Shortcuts in some manner. Folders, tags, at this stage I don't really care (probably folders, considering the poor treatment tags get in Files on iOS), but let me group and organise Shortcuts in a manner logical to me. Mac VersionThis is probably a way off, but if we could get Shortcuts on the Mac then I think a lot of people would be very excited. URL Schemes are already supported, and just the ability to edit these things on yet another one of your devices would be much appreciated. Automator's limitations from the built in actions really show in comparison to Shortcuts, (e.g. the add Calendar Event action in Automator only lets you hard code dates/times natively, whereas Shortcuts allows you to type \"next Tuesday at 9am\" and will calculate the date for you). More System ControlsThere are many things people would love to control through Shortcuts, from VPN to which Airplay device music should play to. These would deepen the amazing integration that's already there and I can't see anyone being upset that you can control a VPN when you can already control the Wifi.‚Ä©### Allow Donation of More Powerful ActionsiOS 12 made an impressive start by allowing app developers to donate (that's really the term) Shortcuts to Siri, I hope to see iOS 13 take this up a notch.Accept Input and Return OutputIf the donated Shortcuts could accept input and return output instead of requiring us to work around things with the clipboard this would both make things more flexible for us as users, and preserve our clipboards too.Editable ActionsDonated actions are \"finished\" items right now - you can't edit them, this is fine if there is an equivalent way to create this action yourself, but what I'm personally finding is that a donated action is a great one, but I would like to use it as the base for something else quite often. Being able to specify which OmniFocus Perspective I'd like to open by typing the name, or choosing from a list would be a boon, and hopefully would also clear up some of the Send a message to Mum \"I'm running 5 minutes late\" littering my action list right now.‚Ä©Shortcuts App StoreWe have stickers, why not shortcuts? This would be a way for Apple to extend the gallery, whilst also giving people a vetted source of Shortcuts (assuming there is a Shortcuts review). I would think this would require some way to hide the actions in a Shortcut - perhaps a \"Run Only\" mode for these. I'm sure that the MacStories collection would become available in short order, and I would be happy to make Shortcuts and put them on the Shortcuts store too. iMessage ShortcutsiMessage apps may not have been as popular as Apple envisioned, but letting us program our own Shortcuts to use in iMessage with just a tap would make life easier for everything from sharing availability to rick rolling your friends.watchOSThis is stolen from Twitter, but I would love to see this grid based dock in the next version of watchOS.Another major element I‚Äôd love is a grid-based dock.

I could let it read my email inbox and auto create itineraries, but I prefer to choose which emails to forward to it. As I mentioned on the show I also have a filter in Gmail that marks and read and deletes all of the \"Your TripIt Itinerary was imported\" emails - I only need to do something if it didn't work after all.Bear Notes for Trips David rolls his own travel schedule system - with Bear. The advantage of Bear is you can easily add attachments and text to a document, meaning everything is in the same place. You can even use a nice Shortcut to allow you to append a document or text to a specific Bear note: Append to BearZapier Turning New Trips into OmniFocus Projects This is an automation I mentioned that is a little hacky, but it works well for me. TripIt creates a calendar, or you can use any of your own calendars for this if you don't want to use TripIt - you just need to get that calendar into Google Calendar. What we do is we watch this calendar for new events, then we filter - continuing if the length of the event is more than 23 hours. Then I use the text action to write up the TaskPaper I want to be added to OmniFocus, and URL encode it. The final step is to add a task to OmniFocus - this is accomplished via the MailDrop, and it has a URL scheme which looks something like omnifocus:///paste?target=/folder/Travel&amp;content=  -%202019/09%20-%20Amsterdam%0A%09-%20Organise%20Travel in the body - so when this task arrives in my inbox and I process it, I just tap on the URL to add the project. You can even run a Shortcut via a URL scheme (which I usually do!). The Zapier steps are:   New Event     Watch the specific calendar in Google Calendar      Only Continue If         Duration (hours) Greater than 23         Text (Formatter)         I typed my TaskPaper in here, and URL encoded it, if you already have    the URL encoded text, or another URL you want to appear in the body of    the task ready you can skip this step.         Create Task         The title is \"Set up project for trip Event Name\", which I also    include in the Text action above. The body is the URL I will tap on when    I process the task.       This series of steps is a pretty solid way to add projects and tasks to OmniFocus based on other events happening, I use it for lots of automations.Rose's Packing List Shortcuthttps://youtu.be/4gJfgDKWH8k I use a modular approach to create my packing list - along with an extra list of devices to charge! While I save this to OmniFocus you could easily modify this to work in any task management system, or just to create a PDF to print if that's what you prefer to do.Naming Documents with Scanner Pro  Scanner Pro is an app David and I both use to scan documents on the go - as well as when we're on the road. It has built-in OCR, and Workflows which allow you to chain multiple actions together. Most of the time I use a Workflow called \"Simple Scan\" which formats the name to Scan Year-Month-Day,  Time and saves the document as a PDF to Dropbox. I usually save to a specific folder in Dropbox which Hazel then watches and automatically files certain things or me.Airmail Custom Actions for a Trip Airmail is a mail app for power users, especially with its custom actions. I have a custom action which forwards the email to TripIt and then moves it to my Gmail account's Travel tag, this allows me to find all my travel email quickly if I need it, and gets it into TripIt without me needing to remember to forward it as well.Quickly Add Travel to your Calendar with Shortcuts This Shortcut isn't really generic, but hopefully, it will inspire some of you. To get to the airport I take a tram and then a train (at least most of the time). The tram normally takes 11 minutes to get to the train station, and then the train should take 16 minutes to get to the airport. While I could use the public transit API to get all of the information to figure out my route to the airport I prefer to look at the available times in the app and choose which one I would prefer to take - before adding this to my calendar. This Shortcut asks me for the departure and arrival time for each mode of transport (and automatically suggests the arrival time based on the departure time) allowing me to just input 2 dates and times most of the time. You can grab it here: Airport Travel.

Time tracking is something some people are required to do, some people ought to do, and something everyone should try at least once just so you can see where all your time is going and how many of those \"it will just take 2 minute\" tasks really take 45 minutes. David and Mike Schmitz talked about how to figure out what you shouldn't be doing in episode 53 of Focused (formerly Free Agents), and that's one of the things I've kept an eye on through my time tracking - things that are taking a lot of my time, that I don't truly enjoy doing or that I know aren't beneficial to me.My Oversleeping Tracker Now, depending on the day of the week, this should perhaps more accurately be called my \"lazing in bed\" tracker, I title it oversleeping by default - you could call it whatever you like. This is is a solid example of a tracker which should automatically start at a specific time. To make it I kept things simple - the trigger is the schedule action, set for 6am in my case. I have set it not to run on Saturdays and Sundays. Then the actions are as follows: Toggl, start a time entry (not create!) - I set the workspace, project (called Personal), and add a description of \"Oversleeping\". The final action is to send myself a Pushbullet link notification. I misremembered during the episode but I am actually triggering a Shortcut, the link is simply shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=Stop%20Toggl (you can download the Shortcut here, you'll need to have the Toggl app installed for it to work), and the title is actually the description of the Toggl timer - so if I change what I put in the description later I don't need to remember to update the notification name. If you're on the free version of Toggl then you'll have to skip the notification part. That's it! When the Zap runs it starts the timer, and sends me a notification - and when I open that notification it opens Shortcuts, which stops the timer. You could have it open the Toggl web page instead - or any number of things if you wanted to do so. (You could also run a different Shortcut, one which starts playing your morning playlist, tells you what events are on your calendar, etc., as well as stopping the timer.)My Zapier Stop Timer Automation This one does the opposite of the above - it stops a currently running timer at 10pm. The trick with this is you will need to use the Toggl API, and as such you'll need a premium Zapier plan to do this (you could use Microsoft Flow if you're comfortable doing the whole thing via APIs though, and that's free!). So, how does it work?   Every day at 10pm is the schedule which triggers this, I have it run on  weekends too.    GET - I make a call to the Toggl API. I call the URL  https://www.toggl.com/api/v8/time_entries/current, and make  sure to fill out the Basic Auth field with email|password.    Only continue if: the data returned by Toggl has a negative duration if the  timer is still running, so if it's less than zero I continue.  Stop Time Entry - using the ID captured from the GET in step 2.   Send a link via PushBullet. This opens the alternative Toggl app I'm beta  testing so I can just continue the timer if necessary.   A note: while I am doing some of my Toggl automations through IFTTT that is via their Maker service and the API, it doesn't have direct integration with Toggl itself.https://youtu.be/9sm5gxFOaMo Automators Episode 15: Automated Time TrackingA big thanks to our sponsors for this episode:   ExpressVPN: High-Speed,  Secure &amp; Anonymous VPN Service.

But also, eek. That means it's time for new chargers. Now, I'll grant you, I'm a nerd and I love shopping for new chargers! But trying to find one I want, that charges the devices I want, which can be shipped to me (Austria uses Amazon Germany, and as many residents of Austria are aware, lots of things \"Cannot be shipped to Austria\" - for reasons unknown) is actually not that fun after 3 hours of trying to figure it all out.My primary search criteria over the last few months has been \"more than one USB C port\", this has been a challenge, to say the least. One of the things I decided I was willing to capitulate on early on was that it should also be able to charge my MacBook Pro. I love my 15\" device, but in hindsight maybe I should have gone 13\" - as then it just needs 60W of power. But as a friend said not long ago, when does the 15\" really need 87W of power? For intensive things yes, but for writing scripts, blog posts, even running MAMP as my virtual server? Not so much. Then CES happened. As always, there were lots of shinies - some of which are weird and probably won't be seen or heard from again. However, there were also the \"ready to ship\" things, including a new charger from Satechi.This charger is the success to my previous Anker 5 port charger - one of those ports being a USB C PD port. The Satechi though, has 2 USB C ports, one 60W, one 18W (handily noted in very small font below the ports), and 2 USB A ports. So technically I'm losing a port - but as I always take a small single USB A port device with me for use in the airport I can manage if I really need 5 ports at once. I've been putting the charger through its paces since I got it on Tuesday, and I'm impressed.I've been using the 60W port for my MacBook Pro, it works, it's a little slower than the 87W when the device is in use - but I can live with that. The 18W has been used for my iPad Pro and Nintendo Switch, it works great - they both charge quickly with no issues. The other two ports have an Apple Watch cable plugged in, and an Anker 3 in 1 cable (Micro USB, Lightning, USB C), the latter for charging my iPhone, AirPods, Bose headphones, and also for powering my Raspberry Pi Zero Portable development server. Usually, chargers get warm when using them, it's currently charging my MBP (which is asleep), this iPad which I'm writing the blog post on, my Apple Watch and my iPhone XS Max. If I touch the charger it's slightly warm, that's it. When I was using my MacBook Pro earlier today and charging my Bose headphones, and Nintendo Switch it got a little warmer, but still pleasant to touch. One of the reasons why I wanted this charger is it takes a standard figure of 8 cable, and it's 110V-240V. That means I can just swap the cable and use it at home in Europe, as well as here in the US (it wasn't available for purchase in the EU and as I was on my way here it seemed like an opportune moment to get it!). https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/review-satechi-75w-dual-type-c-pd-travel-charger/satechi-charger.jpeg)What does it look like? Size wise, similar to my 87W MBP charger - it's a little longer, but also shorter, thickness and weight wise they feel about the same. It's space grey, and has one cable coming out of the back for power, and depending on what you want to charge, up to 4 out of the front - that means it can look a little messy but for the price of power I'll take it! It does have a blue LED on the front, thankfully it's quite dim and hasn't disturbed my sleep over the last few nights. That being said, when I get home I'll put some electrical tape over it - there's nothing worse than a light when you're trying to sleep and can't - it may as well be the eye of Sauron!","url":"/blog/review-satechi-75w-dual-type-c-pd-travel-charger/","excerpt":"<p>Everything is changing to USB C - great!

When it dropped in price a little I caved and flexed my credit card. (For the curious I found the iPhone on eBay from a UK seller - I picked the seller with the highest ratings and everything went smoothly.)Why dual sim? For many people this is unnecessary, in my case I am fortunate enough to have both my work mobile number and my personal mobile number on one sim, however I have an older personal number, and my UK number which I still receive messages on - and in the case of the UK sim I often use it when travelling (both to the UK and other places as the provider, Three, offer good travel packages). Some people have separate work and personal sims, and it's definitely nice to have the option of switching sims when travelling if only to get a cheaper data plan, whilst being able to keep your regular number to receive incoming calls or messages.So, it's pretty simple to use and works precisely as documented by Apple, you pop out the sim tray, the sim on the back is held in with a small plastic spring and the one on the front is held in with gravity. Once you put the sims in you get asked how you want to use them, and off you go. I don't have an e-sim option at all, which means if I travel somewhere and want a local sim I'll have to buy it first. That said, in most countries there's only one e-sim provider and they're usually not the cheapest so I probably wouldn't use them anyway.The only thing missing from this setup is the ability to use both numbers with iMessage - unfortunately you're limited to using the primary number with FaceTime and iMessage. However in my case I chose to use my email address as my primary contact information for iMessage a long time ago which alleviates that issue quite nicely!Now to the Max itself. I was previously a member of the of the Plus club (as it was christened by the fabulous hosts of Connected. In 2017 I thought that the X would be perfect for me and it was indeed an excellent device - but I really do like the bigger screen! With the Max I caved to the trends and bought a pop socket as recommended on Cortex - and my little finger is very thankful for this as I have previously rested the iPhone on that finger.The very exciting part of the S and R series of iPhones of course is the ability to read NFC tags without opening an app first - this is going to be a great automation possibility, simply because I can be prompted to run automations when I put my iPhone down in specific places such as by my bed. I'm very sure app developers are going to be taking advantage of this! Launch Center Pro has already updated to support this ability and it's coming in handy - for everything from triggering shortcuts to accessing OmniFocus perspectives.The one thing I had not realised I was missing was battery life. With my X I needed to charge the device most evenings when getting home from work, now I can make it until bedtime and I often have about 40% battery remaining (unless I play Pok√©mon Go, which requires a battery pack on any device). I've already seen how useful this is on trips - while I always have a battery pack handy it's nice not to need it, or at least to not be tethered to it. I won't be travelling long haul until I visit Seattle for PodCon later this month - but I suspect with low power mode I would be able to get by with just a small battery pack if I choose to do so. All in all, I'm very happy with the Xs Max and don't regret getting it at all. Was my X good? Definitely! And I wouldn't recommend this move to most people, but for me it definitely resulted in benefits so was definitely worth it.","url":"/blog/dual-sim-iphone-xs-max-review-3-months-on/","excerpt":"<p>When the iPhones were announced last year I had decided before the event that I wasn't upgrading, and for a while after the event I held out - until I found out I could get a real dual sim iPhone XS Max from Hong Kong, which means no restrictions or modifications to iOS, and real dual sim capabilities.

I've been a big fan of Launch Center Pro for years, it was around long before Shortcuts and has a massive collection of URL schemes in it for starters. You may well be thinking that now we have Shortcuts, Pythonista, Scriptable, Drafts and more we don't need Launch Center Pro anymore though - and we dive into this in the podcast. Launch Center Pro can do automations by itself, anything which can be done via URL scheme is triggerable - but that's not all. It offers a GUI to build a URL scheme (which you could take and use elsewhere if you wanted to). You can also specify that you want user input in a variety of formats, choosing from a list, keyboard or numberpad input, scanning a barcode, dictation and more! Launch Center Pro can also URL encode text for you if it's placed in double%20curly%20brackets - and to make things more user friendly you put in one of the GUI fields when building a URL scheme will be preserved exactly as you have written it and wrapped in those brackets allowing you to edit it easily.Time Based Launchers If you want to remember to check the weather at 7am everyday, look in TestFlight for beta updates, or to send a message at 5pm then you can achieve this with Launch Center Pro, it can do anything from launching a mind-bogglingly long list of apps, to anything which can be done through URL schemes (and more, but I'll get to that). In the new version you canOne Off Alerts As well as alerts appearing every Wednesday at 9pm you can also have a one time alert appear, this is ideal for things like \"I need to ask my boyfriend X, Y and Z via WhatsApp\", I can just modify the text that will be sent and set the alert to trigger say 30 minutes after my flight lands.Location Based Launchers Launching maps for your route to work everyday at 8am is all very well, but wouldn't it be better to have that trigger when you leave your house? Launch Center Pro can prompt you to do things like this based on location - you can have something prompt you when you arrive a location, leave it, or both.iBeacons GPS is great, but it's also not the most accurate, so when I arrive at work I like to check my OmniFocus work perspective (rather than seeing how many tasks I have which need to be completed at work), but if I use GPS I'll get prompted when I get off the tram outside, which means when I actually get into my office on the 6th floor about 10 minutes later I will have forgotten or dismissed the notification already, or worse still looked at the perspective and forgotten what I'd seen in it. To alleviate this issue I use iBeacons - little devices used for indoor location tracking. They're not hard to setup, just copy the iBeacon ID into the field in LCP and let it do the work. I have one I put in my suitcase too when travelling which means I can toggle on my travel launchers for reminders when arriving at/leaving my hotel room easily. The one at work lives in my desk drawer and it usually triggers between me exiting the lift and actually getting into my room which is perfect.Time and Location Based Launchers Location based things are great, but if I go past the supermarket on a Sunday there's no point in reminding me to buy juice - the supermarket is closed (in Austria most retail locations are closed on Sundays). I use a really nice feature to limit when these location based reminders pop up, so if I'm on my way home from the airport at midnight then the location based trigger won't show up.NFC Tags NFC tags are brand new to Launch Center Pro 3 - they're truly techie stickers which can trigger a notification when you touch them, and the ones from the Contrast Shop will let you attach them to Launch Center Pro 3 and actions within it. You can even attach the same sticker to more than one action, and then pick from the provided menu when you open the notification.Quick Access to Stuff Some apps have things buried deep in menus, or you simply need to scroll a lot to get to it. Launch Center Pro can frequently give you speedy access to things - such as next month in Fantastical, a new email to a specific person in Airmail, or prepare actions for you such as starting a new Glympse and sending it via email. As promised on the show, this is my shortcut to weigh myself. I have FitBit scales and unfortunately they don't sync to the health app. Rather than use another ap to sync from FitBit to Health I just input the data directly - and have it calculate my BMI at the same time for an extra data point: [Log Scales Data](whilst it: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/bf4b02fd3afd48778aa0e867fda01884).

I've been hard at work on this for the last 3 months - but not alone. My fabulous co-author, Ryan Dotson, has been hard at work right along side me (admittedly with a timezone difference) - and we have 150 pages ready for you!This book is designed, as the name implies, to help you build a workflow which works for you with OmniFocus - whether you've never used the app before, or if you've used it for years and just want to improve your setup. It is comprised of five sections:First Steps: Getting OmniFocus set up with a basic setup.Fundamentals: Walking you through the default perspectives, and expanding on your current setup - plus diving into settings.Advancing: Diving much deeper, including custom perspectives, creative uses for tags, review and onwards.Final Horizons: Honing your workflow to get the most out of your system.Our Workflows: Ryan and I get personal and tell you about how our setups work.Throughout the book there are tips, notes, personal comments, and most important of all: activities for you to complete in order for you to create a set up which allows you to be productive and which will hopefully also allow you to feel like you're fully in control of your life.OmniFocus is a remarkably flexible app and can adapt to practically any workflow. As such, everyone must go through the process of building their own workflow with it, whether from scratch or based upon someone else‚Äôs. Build Your OmniFocus Workflow, written with the insight of two long-time OmniFocus users, offers practical advice on top of solid technical information. Ryan and Rose guide you through the basic concepts and perspectives of OmniFocus and into the more complex world of custom perspectives and automation. All throughout they give their own interpretations of how they use features in their workflows and finish the book with more details about how their systems work for them.Build Your OmniFocus Workflow is available for a short time at launch for $25. The price will increase in the new year to $30.This book is not static, we intend to update it when new features are added to any of the OmniFocus platforms. That is not to say the book is incomplete, we have about 40,000 words and are very happy to release it today!Now, to the nerdier side of things. You may be thinking \"I've never heard of Ryan\" - and until I started beta testing OmniFocus 3 for iOS I hadn't either! In fact, Ryan and I have never actually met in person - the internet put us together (with some help from The Omni Group), and we ended up writing a book. If that's not a testament to how wonderful the world can be I don't know what is! I'm going to go through a little of how we wrote the book, just to give you a taste.We started by mapping ideas out in iThoughts. We thought we'd write Markdown files and check them into a private GitHub repo - but for a variety of reasons realised this wasn't going to work how we had originally envisioned so quickly moved over to Scrivener where the project has been ever since. Scrivener has excellent Dropbox sync support so we worked through that, back and forth - with differing timezones coming in handy as you can only have one copy of a Scrivener file open at once. Once we had a large chunk of the book written then came the hard part: formatting.I have a confession, I had very little input on the formatting. By which I mean the styling formatting rather than the organisation of the book. Ryan had a hidden talent for this from which I have learnt a great deal! If you think the book looks pretty that's down to him. From the font choices, to the indentation, and the whimsy of the hands for the notes and tips, Ryan did all the hard work. Just don't ask him about list formatting, he's still recovering from that.The cover design was done by the extremely talented Josh Hughes. Josh has also designed a series of icons for OmniFocus custom perspectives.Get the book here!

In episode 11 of Automators we have gone into why you might want to try this crazy fad and how we're using it ourselves, so - let's dive in! There's numerous reasons why you might want to have Shortcuts on your home screen: To run your shortcut, yes - an obvious one, but a worthy one.   To give you context - e.g. when I tap on my Automators icon I get the  options I want when I'm wearing my Automators hat.  To run multiple actions at once - such as starting a timer.   To put one app or shortcut in multiple places, so Quip is in my Learn  OmniFocus and my Automators shortcuts, but the Quip app itself could only be  in one folder.  To assist less technical folks with an iOS device. You can build these Shortcuts very simply: with a Choose from Menu and either Open App or Run Shortcut actions. I put together a short YouTube video on that for you.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrC0OKEqRBM One of the examples Shortcuts I talked about was my Home shortcut, this lets me choose from different scenes at different times of day - something you may want to incorporate into other Shortcuts, here's how it works:  The trick is to format the date action to give you just the hour, and then you can nest if actions to get what you want. You can download this Shortcut sample here. David talked about his Shortcut to take a nap - it sets an alarm and turns on Do Not Disturb. You can download that Shortcut here, it will ask you how long you want to take naps for too: Take a Nap. David made a video where you can see how he does his different contexts with Shortcuts:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtHntEP39bk And you can download a sample Shortcut here. We also dived into customising Shortcuts, as promised here's a Shortcut to put that blank character on your clipboard so you can have Shortcuts with no name: Copy Whitespace. As we mentioned on the show, you can put Shortcuts just like these in a widget too - and here's a bonus trick for you. Tap on Show More on your Shortcuts Widget, and then at the bottom tap Customise in Shortcuts - this lets you enable and disable Shortcuts in the widget, as well as change the order of them quickly.

I have several bags I love which fitted the 10.5\" iPad perfectly - and I'm very pleased to report that my 11\" iPad is not going to require a change in my handbag collection üòâ.After attaching the Smart Keyboard folio I became slightly concerned by the weight of the device, but I weighed it very scientifically - with the 10.5\" and Smart Keyboard in one hand and the 11\" and Smart Keyboard folio in the other, there's not much of a difference in it, and as I won't be using the leather slip case anymore I have no qualms about the weight. Scientifically it's about 50g heavier than the 10.5\" iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard. The Smart Keyboard folio itself is good, slightly clickier than the previous ones - especially on the space bar. It is sturdier than the previous model in my lap which is where I frequently use it. The second angle is however essentially useless to me, much too steep unless I'm putting the iPad on a relatively high table to watch media on. That said that second groove is a good place to put my Apple Pencil when I'm not using it if I don't want to put it on the side of the iPad for whatever reason. The Smart Keyboard is however a very boring shade of grey with just the fold and the camera cutout on the back, and not even that on the front. It would be nice if Apple offered this in a few different colours - at least on the outside.I really like the new Apple Pencil. I'm no artist however I use the iPad frequently to take notes by hand and sketch out ideas. The ability to switch between tools with a double tap is very useful - and I'm very pleased to see several apps such as OmniGraffle and Notability have already implemented support for it.The new screen size does of course bring some challenges with it - namely that apps have to update again to support these new screen sizes. Of course, I primarily use apps such as Airmail, Drafts, and OmniFocus which have all been updated for these new sizes already! Facebook however looks terrible - and I don't think they ever got around to supporting the original 12.9\" so I highly doubt we'll see an update there any time soon! That said I rarely use Facebook nowadays so it's no problem.Most people of course don't need to upgrade to this iPad Pro from the last one - and for most people I'd even suggest they get the older generation which is still for sale in the 10.5\" size. I use the iPad as my primary device though, leaving my 15\" MacBook Pro on my desk at home when I can - and I've been looking for a larger screen size on the iPad without going back to the full size 12.9\" behemoth! This definitely fits that bill no problem.I did consider ordering the 12.9\" - and I've looked at it in the store too, but frankly it's still too big and heavy for me. While I don't get two full size apps side by side on the 11\" I generally don't notice or mind - in fact in some cases like when using Shortcuts in split screen it's definitely a blessing that it scales down to be a mobile screen when I have a list or menu to select from as they get pushed to the bottom of the screen. My iPad goes almost everywhere with me and I would like to keep that up, if it's too big or heavy that won't happen and I'll go back to browsing Twitter on my iPhone instead of reading or doing something productive.I'm definitely happy with my purchase, and this year I'm not going to keep the 12.9\" around as my big iPad (for one I'd have to keep two separate pencils!) - I'm consolidating my devices and am pleased the screen size of the 11\" will allow me to do so.","url":"/blog/ipad-11-first-impressions/","excerpt":"<p>My iPad Pro 11\" with Smart Keyboard folio and Apple Pencil arrived just before 10am on Wednesday (earlier than I could have got it at the Apple Store) and I've been putting it through its paces ever since.</p>\n"},{"id":"blog-automators-10-zapier","title":"Automators 10: Zapier","categories":null,"tags":["Automators","Podcast"],"content":"Episode 10 of Automators is all about Zapier.

St√∏vring","categories":null,"tags":["Automators","Podcast"],"content":"Episode 9 of Automators is all about Scriptable, a great app released for iOS 12 which allows you to control your device with JavaScript. We were fortunate enough to have the developer of Scriptable, Simon B. St√∏vring come on the podcast to tell us about the app and some of the things it can do. I'm going to use this article to give you a quick overview of Scriptable - if I wanted to detail everything you'd probably end up reading a 10,000 word post and this is supposed to be a blog post to accompany a podcast! So, let's get started. Scriptable is a framework which lets you control your device by writing scripts - much like Shortcuts it doesn't do anything itself directly, but instead it enables you to write code which can do anything from check if Slack is down by reading a webpage, to manipulate your contacts, read an API key from your keychain, and even more.Scriptable includes several example scripts: ASCIIwwdc: This gets the transcript for any WWDC video Countdown to Midnight Import Selected File to Bear Is Slack Down? Latest News on MacStories Reminders Due Today Vue JSON   Watchlist: Manages a list of films you'd like to watch, which you share to  it from the IMDB app    What is shared: A script which shows you how to interpret the sharesheet  from various apps on iOS  Comic in Siri Inside the app there's documentation which tells you what you can do directly with the device, this includes: Alert Calendar Contacts Device Dictation Document Picker Mail Message Photos Reminders Safari ... and much more! All of these are on top of what is regularly available in JavaScript - just like Drafts, Scriptable uses ES6 JavaScript, this is the most recent version and you can find a very comprehensive guide, plus tutorials on the Mozilla Developer site. We also mentioned the CodeAcademy JavaScript course which is good place to start learning JavaScript. Another app we mentioned during the show was Pythonista which is a powerful scripting app for iOS - as you might guess from the name it's Python based rather than JavaScript. Every Scriptable script can be added to Siri right from it's settings page, this is also where you can add it to Launch Center Pro, copy the URL scheme, say what the script can accept as input, or specify the script should always run in the app - listen to the chapter at 17:59 to find out why you might need to do this! Towards the end of the show Simon mentioned some of the things he was working on and while he couldn't make any promises when we recorded, Scriptable has been updated today! The update includes, auto complete, interactive tables, the ability to evaluate JavaScript in a WebView, a new contacts bridge, and more. Even if you don't know JavaScript and have no intention of learning it I highly recommend you download the app and try the example scripts - and don't forget to check out the Scriptable category in the forums for more example scripts too. Thank you very much to Simon for coming on the show, and thank you to Omni Group - makers of OmniFocus - for sponsoring it! Episode 9: Scriptable with Simon B.

Unfortunately very few people used this service so it was discontinued in OmniFocus 3 - but I have an alternative! Someone in the OmniFocus Slack pointed me to this post in the OmniFocus forums to help you create calendar events from your OF database and I got stuck in. The first thing I decided was that OmniFocus should have its own calendar, this made life much easier later so I highly recommend you do this too. The next step was to decide how long events should be input for if they have no estimated time. The old built in option used an hour which I found too long so I set mine to 30 minutes. I am using Keyboard Maestro to run this script hourly, but to prevent duplicate events showing up it makes sense to delete the existing events first.

The name of the task becomes the name of the event. The task note becomes the event note   If the task has an estimated duration this is used, otherwise the event is  set to whatever the default_duration property is at the top of the list (30  minutes in this example)    The due date and the duration of the event are used to calculate the start  date  The URL of the event is set to be a URL back to the task  I don't use the calendar much myself (preferring Fantastical) so I also have Keyboard Maestro quit the calendar afterwards for me. This Macro uses the cron timer in Keyboard Maestro to run hourly, I've added it to a specific group so it only runs on one of my Macs too. When you download it you will need to enable it, first make sure you create an OmniFocus calendar though, and if you give this calendar a different name then you'll need to update the Macro too. This approach has several advantages over the original OmniFocus implementation: I can sync this calendar, and store it in whichever service I like. I can control the default length of events. I could choose to exclude certain events if I wished to.   It could be a jumping off point for other scripts - such as a calendar of  events you have completed if you wanted one of those.  You could of course use other approaches to run the script automatically, or run it manually when you want to, it's entirely up to you!

Not too long later I was invited to the beta of Scriptable, and got stuck in. Scriptable is an iOS 12 app, and has integration with Siri Shortcuts to help you automate to the max. Simon has integrated a huge number of iOS APIs - so you can get your current location, communicate directly with the calendar, and more. The app also uses native UI elements too - so if you write a script that shows an alert the JavaScript you write calls the native alert box. So, what can you do with this app? The built in examples include getting the current Slack status, grabbing the latest XKCD comic, and viewing shared JSON in a readable format. There are many more sample scripts over on the Automators Forums where I host a community run forum for the app (what better home than with Automators?).  You can also trigger Scriptable scripts in any number of ways. When you tap the settings icon inside of a script you get the option to immediately add the script to Siri, you can copy the URL scheme to the app, and even add it directly to Launch Center Pro which will then let you trigger notifications to run it at specific times or places.

I'm extremely happy to have had Workflow - and what's more I'm happy to say goodbye to it because today Shortcuts launches and we have nearly everything that was in Workflow - and a way for app developers to hook straight into the app and the operating system.What are we losing?This question was what came to my mind at WWDC, I try not to be negative but a concern for many of us Workflow and automation nerds was \"what won't work anymore?\". Thankfully there are only a few things which we have truly lost:File manipulation in BoxTriggering IFTTT AppletsPost to SlackSave to Transmit (as the app is no longer on the iOS App Store it's not a surprise)Post to TumblrEdit ImageSend via DeskConnect (also unsurprising - the service was shut down long ago).The only one of these that really causes difficulties is the edit image action, while you can still crop images and various other actions you can no longer do so in an interactive manner as part of a Shortcut.What have we gained?We have gained a lot in Shortcuts, here's a list of actions which to my knowledge didn't exist in Workflow but are part of Shortcuts - but aren't donated to Siri by an app developer.Add to Draft (Drafts 5)Get Contents of Draft (Drafts 5)Open Draft (Drafts 5)Run Drafts Action (Drafts 5)MarkupRequest PaymentRun Javascript on Web PageSend PaymentSet Airplane ModeSet BluetoothSet Cellular DataSet Do Not DisturbSet Low Power ModeSet Wi-FiShow ResultThe last action is most interesting to me - it works like an alert if you run a Shortcut from Shortcuts, but will display the answer in Siri if you call the shortcut from Siri. The dictation action has also had an upgrade - allowing it to stop automatically after a pause, or a short pause, or on a tap (you can choose). This makes Shortcuts much more useful if you're using it via Siri.What's still to come?The possibilities here are seemingly endless - I've already seen many of the apps I use daily updating to support Shortcuts, from Waterminder to TripIt, Carrot to Working Copy, and many more. What we get now will be up to the app developers - but they seem to be making the most of it!","url":"/blog/wave-goodbye-to-workflow-say-hello-to-shortcuts/","excerpt":"<p><img src=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/09/workflow-to-shortcuts.jpeg\" /></p>\n"},{"id":"blog-using-tripit-with-siri-shortcuts","title":"Using TripIt with Siri Shortcuts","categories":null,"tags":[],"content":"I was most pleasantly surprised today to see an update to the TripIt app which added support for Siri Shortcuts.

Here's a quick overview of all the features added:Shortcuts SupportShortcuts Action in DraftsWith the release of Shortcuts and it replacing Workflow we've got a fair few actions to update - thankfully the Shortcuts actions work the same way as Workflow ones did, so you can easily replace them. If you have an older device which Shortcuts doesn't support but Drafts does then you can keep using Workflow though. There's documentation on running Shortcuts in Drafts too.ShortcutsBoy this is getting confusing! In iOS 12 every app has the option of telling Siri what you've been doing (stored locally on your device for privacy and security reasons), and these can then be suggested to you. This also means we can use these in the Shortcuts app as part of a longer chain of things - or individually (best set up via Settings &gt; Siri &amp; Search to avoid cluttering your Shortcuts app with potentially hundreds of one action automations!), via Siri or through typing in the search. We can use these to capture the clipboard, launch dictation, or view a specific draft which is ideal for reference material. Inside of Drafts you can add specific Drafts to Siri, and to add a Workspace.Separators in Action GroupsWe can now add separators in action groups - these are what they sound like, little dividers which help you split up your actions. It's a small visual indication, but a big help when you have a longer list of actions - or many which are similar. Don't Sleep While WorkingAs part of a script step you can now tell your device you don't want it to autosleep using app.isIdleDisabled - I've built this into some of my blogging actions so when I start a new post my device remains awake but when I publish it goes back to normal :) Dropbox APIOne thing Shortcuts no longer does is integration with Dropbox, thankfully Drafts has come to my rescue by adding the Dropbox API! Details in the Scripting Reference. Look for ready to use example actions, like \"Create on Dropbox Paper\" in the Action Directory. I've created several actions which save files in multiple formats to specific directories in Dropbox and copy the folder URL back to my clipboard which is great for when I'm working on things things I am sharing with others! This alone makes Drafts worth the subscription price for me :)Wordpress IntegrationI didn't think anything would make me consider going back to Wordpress, but this nearly did! Drafts now has native integration which is quite simply wonderful. Google Drive EnhancementsYou can now create fully styled documents and PDFs through the Upload option when combined with the HTML Preview actions - and much more. Text uploads also support appending or prepending, and you can also upload Markdown and HTML.OtherThere's a nice new light grey theme which I'm using for \"bright sunlight\" days.You can easily copy the UUID or the text of a Draft to the clipboard through the ‚ìò button, as well as a link to a Draft.There's a lot of tweaks for better performance!You can see the full, official, release notes here.You can get Drafts 5 on the App Store.","url":"/blog/drafts-5-4/","excerpt":"<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1236254471?at=1010lumu\" class=\"image-right\">)</a> Drafts 5.4 is here today, and while it feels like it was just yesterday when it was released Greg has found numerous ways to improve things!

David and I are both OmniFocus users, but project templates can be used with almost every task management system out there - even Reminders! The simplest type of project template is a project you can copy - this is easily done in both OmniFocus and Things, the advantage is it's easy to set up, but it's also static - what you have is what you get. You can also store project templates somewhere else, the places I have used are: Editorial iCloud Drive Dropbox Drafts Workflow/Shortcuts One thing I have done is to import all of the templates I'd previously saved into Dropbox and iCloud Drive into Drafts - this was easily done by pressing and holding the + icon which then lets you import a file. Something I use a lot when making templates for OmniFocus is TaskPaper - and I even made a Drafts Action Group to help me do so easily. What you can do with OmniFocus and TaskPaper is create a template in OmniFocus, copy it and then paste it into a text editor (like Drafts) to edit it - this allows you to put \"fuzzy dates\" in, such as \"Thursday\" or \"Monday -2d\", the latter evaluating to two days before Monday. You can also include ¬´variables¬ª which the TaskPaper to OF action will then help you replace.I demonstrated how to use this action group in a screencast for you:https://youtu.be/xit6JLmbnZY And there's also a blog post all about it: Using Drafts 5 Taskpaper with OmniFocus As I mentioned in the podcast, Todoist supports importing a CSV file - and if your task manager does too then you can use Numbers or Excel and date math to make relative dates.So, what kind of project templates might you create? Packing Lists Publishing a podcast episode Writing and submitting an essay/report And much more! While David and I are both primarily OmniFocus users, there are also lots of great resources for Things users:   Using AppleScript With Things - Things Support - Cultured Code  - a 24 page guide.    Things on iOS: The Complete Guide to Automations and Workflows    Things URL Scheme - Things Support - Cultured Code    Three workflows for quickly adding project templates and tasks to Things   on iOS ‚Äì The Sweet Setup    And a thread from the Automators forums:  Help with Things 3 URL Scheme for Project Templates    Drafts actions:         New Project in Things      Things Parser    And the Todoist blog also has a post called A whole new way to create and share Todoist Templates - Todoist Blog. One of the workflows/Shortcuts I mentioned on the podcast was one to create an essay project, the options here are somewhat simplified, but demonstrate quite nicely how this works:   Essay to OmniFocus    Essay to OmniFocus  As the URL Scheme in Things doesn't support adding headings I formatted the  project in Things somewhat differently - however you can import a JSON which  does support headings format so if you're willing to get stuck in I'm sure  you can figure it out!  Another Workflow/Shortcut I mentioned is the iOS implementation of these scripts:   Populate Template Placeholders‚Äîcurtclifton.net    Tweaking OmniFocus: Project Template Applescript ‚Äî MacSparky    Chris Suave: Templates Applescript for OmniFocus.  What they allow you to do is to store a project in OmniFocus and then run  AppleScript, which will parse out ¬´variables¬ª and create a new  project, with the help of the share sheet and two Workflows I recreated this  functionality and wrote about it on Colter Reed's blog:  How to Fill Out OmniFocus Project Templates with Workflow | Colter   Reed. What is probably interesting for you is that this is not one Workflow but  two, and the second one is recursive - that is it calls itself until a  condition is met, for this workflow that there are not more variables to  parse. Using Workflows/Shortcuts as a function is something I rarely see but  is extremely useful.  David also did a great screencast about how he uses Shortcuts to make project templates: plugin:youtube Make sure to check out the show notes for all of the links, and I look forward to discussing this episode and all of your examples for project templates in the forums!","url":"/blog/automators-5-project-templates/","excerpt":"<p>\n  Episode 5 of Automators is all about project templates, and how they can help\n  you to be more productive.

The catch? My previous system for blogging involved using Transmit and Workflow - and sadly Transmit for iOS is no more. (You may be wondering why I'm only changing my system now, instead of back in January when Panic stopped working on Transmit for iOS. It's simple, it was still supported in Workflow, sadly it is no longer supported in Shortcuts.) This Workflow takes advantage of the stdin input option for the Run Script Over SSH action, in simple terms it means that you can give this action input as well as using variables as input in the script section. A quick lesson on how Grav works for those unfamiliar with it and looking to modify this for Jekyll or another CMS:   There is a User folder where the data for your site is stored (config files,  pages, etc.)    Inside of this folder is the Pages folder, where your pages are stored.    Folders inside of this become slugs the URL, so my blog posts are all in  blog.  The file name is the name of the twig template. To start with I choose where I want to store the post, if it's a link to a guest post it goes in one folder, and a blog post goes in another - this is just my personal preference. I'm using a dictionary to do this because then I can see one option, but have it output something different - as my blog is the second item in my menu I would have to choose 02.blog every time otherwise. The next step is asking for the slug - this is nearly always on my clipboard (because I run this from Drafts and Drafts puts the slug on my clipboard!), then I get the text that was shared to the Workflow and Run Script Over SSH - which is where all the magic happens. The workflow I've shared does the following:cd user/pages/$Chosen_Location;mkdir $Slug;cd $Slug;cat &gt; blogpost.md; I've used the dollar signs here to represent Workflow variables - the key line is the last one, where I save the input of the SSH action to the file blogpost.md.Steps:   Dictionary: This is a list of the folders where I might choose  to save a blog post.    Choose from List: I choose one of those folders    Ask for Input: And grab the slug for the post.    Set Variable: I save the slug to a variable    Get Variable: And then I get the blog post shared to the  Workflow.    Run Script Over SSH: Finally I run the SSH script.  Now, I actually save my blog posts in numbered folders - Grav will drop the number and dot at the start of the a folder name and use the rest of it as a slug, this helps me find posts based on when they were published from a folder list. If I create the post in the Grav admin GUI then it numbers them automatically, but it is possible to do this on the command line too! The script I use is as follows:cd user/pages/$Correct_Location;filecount=$(ls | wc -l);mkdir ${filecount}.$Slug;cd ${filecount}.$Slug;cat &gt; blogpost.md; What this does is it counts the files and folders in the current folder and saves them to a variable on command line called filecount - and then I use this to create the folder for me. This variable is only valid for this session - but that's fine for what we need. The folder where the post will be published contains a file which will display the list of blog posts and this gives me the +1 I need to create the next folder.I hope this script is of use to at least one person!

What's important to keep in mind here is that this is a beta, and an early one at that - things can and likely will change between me writing this post and OmniFocus 3 for Mac being released - they may have already changed by the time you read this post!Stability This is a beta app so there's no guarantees, for me the app has been very stable - but I'm also running it on High Sierra. However as the builds can literally be released every few hours (depending on what is being added or changed) this could change at the drop of a hat - so be warned üòâ.The Icon We have the sketch icon again! It's cute, and helpful to distinguish between the two apps in your dock. Personally I put OmniFocus 2 in a folder in Applications called \"OmniFocus 2\" and the beta in a folder called \"OmniFocus 3\" (yes, I was feeling creative, however did you guess‚ÄΩ). This means if you launch the app via spotlight you get a helpful text hint about which version of the app you're launching too. Forecast View Interleaved tasks and calendar events have made their way to the Mac in the forecast view. This is really handy for putting my day together and I'm a big fan of this on iOS.   I find this view much more beneficial than the gantt style view in OmniFocus 2, just because it brings everything together.Appearance OmniFocus looks different now, for example the toolbar across the top is much slimmer and by default includes fewer actions - though as always you can customise it by right clicking on it to add more options. The sidebar where the perspectives (and any starred custom perspectives) are listed, as well as the area where the project or tag list is shown have a dark background too, which I find helps me focus on the tasks area - the important things!   One place where you can see some subtle, but effective changes to the design is in the inspector. For example the status of the selected item has changed from a dropdown to segmented controls - the iOS equivalent of radio buttons (you have probably seen these in the maps app, to say that you want to see a map, transit, or satellite view). Tags of course have changed too, so that you could see multiple tags which are assigned to the current item at the same time.  Repeats In OmniFocus 3 for iOS we got custom repeats, and these have been brought over to the Mac as well. The place where this really shows is in the monthly where you can specify that a task should repeat on day X of the month, or you can specify a repeat on the yth zday of each month (e.g. the second Tuesday). These repeats have come in very handy for me - for example I submit my timesheet for last month on the first Monday of the next month.   Custom Perspectives Another feature we're now seeing on the Mac is enhanced custom perspectives. You can build these by nesting rules - if you've used Hazel or created smart folders in Finder then you'll be familiar with creating the rules (click the + to add a new one), and you can press ALT++ to add a nested rule. A new feature here that's not yet on iOS is the ability to change the overarching rule, on iOS it defaults to \"all of\", and this can be changed to \"any of\" or \"none of\" in the new Mac version - though at the time of writing this doesn't yet sync to iOS.   I'm very excited about the new OmniFocus 3 for Mac, and really looking forward to seeing how it evolves throughout the beta process!","url":"/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/","excerpt":"<p>\n  <a\n    href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-sketch-icon.png50x150){.image-right\"\n    ><img\n      class=\"alignright\"\n      src=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-sketch-icon.png\"\n      width=\"118\"\n      height=\"118\" /></a\n  >I am once again lucky enough to be in the early preview for OmniFocus 3 -\n  this time on the Mac!

Thankfully however it's quite simple to fix this with my Workflow.

(Not that stickers aren't great of course.)AirmailIf you've ever wanted or needed to send an email attachment via iMessage this is an easy way to do it. You simply get a list of attachments on emails, allowing you to send the file onwards.CitymapperThis particular app is very useful - you can send your current location, a recently searched for destination, or your current trip. Very useful if you're trying to meet up with people!CopiedI love Copied, it's a great clipboard manager that syncs between iOS and macOS, and you have access to images in it iMessage app. I often share to Copied and then I can use either the keyboard or the iMessage app to share things on.DoodleIf you've ever tried to arrange an event that involves more than one person you've done the back and forth of \"are you free then? No, how about next week? FIne, I give up\" (or similar), Doodle is fabulous to help you fix that - you just create a poll when you are available, and everyone votes for the dates that work for them. Well throw that into a group iMessage and you've saved yourself 100 notifications (more or less, depending on the size of the group and how busy their schedules are!).DraftsI often start my writing in Drafts, regardless of what it is, and now I can grab a Draft and send it via iMessage. It's very useful and helps you avoid that copy and paste dance!DropboxIf you want to send a file that's stored in Dropbox this is the easiest way.GlympseI love sharing my location with people to help us find one another, Glympse goes a few steps above Find Friends here. You can choose to share for a time period, or until you get a location - if you do that it calculates the route and shows the person where you are on your route, how fast you're moving, and your estimated arrival time. Being able to share it via iMessage is extremely useful, especially as the other person doesn't need to be using Glympse check on you.MapstrMapstr is one of my favourite apps, I bookmark locations in it all the time, and I frequently want to share them! With the iMessage app you can search for a location - sorted by nearest to you automatically. The shared item results in a map, with the name and tags you have specified - so the person could import it directly if they wanted to.MusicI like to share music with people, they probably heard about it months, years, or decades before I came across it, but it's fun nonetheless. With the iMessage app I can send the exact track I'm listening to right now to a friend - or pick something earlier from my playing history.OneDriveThis works the same way the Dropbox app does, but with OneDrive (funny that). It's pretty useful for Word documents I've had to wrangle.TripItI travel, a lot. At least compared to some people. I love to use TripIt to share parts of my trip with people. It formats things prettily, while still giving them the information they would want.Week CalendarI usually invite people to calendar events if they're involved or affected by it, however sometimes that's not practical. It's nice to be able to share the details of an event though. What's great about this app is it shares both the text (name of the event, start date/time, end date/time), and it also shares a URL, from the URL the person can add an ICS file straight to their calendar of the exact event if they like, or use iOS's smart recogniition to add their own event from the dates.YelpI don't save everything to Mapstr - so Yelp comes in handy, especially when evaluating options. You can search and choose from recently searched for locations, and share them - by default the preview shows an image with the name and rating overlaid - but with the address underneath, so once you've finally picked the perfect pancake place you can head right there.iMessage apps certainly come in handy, which ones are you using?","url":"/blog/useful-imessage-apps/","excerpt":"<p>I was recently asked on Twitter which iMessage apps I use regularly, and thought it might well be worth a blog post - there are some really <em>useful</em> iMessage apps out there, but most people just seem to use stickers!

There are many ways you can automatically create calendar events, and it's useful to be able to do so, to avoid losing information. You can also use calendar events as a trigger to do something - which we cover towards the end. Below there are details of all the automations we cover, including 4 (really, four!) screencasts.Workflow: Calendar Event Templates  This is a very simple Workflow which asks me for the date and time of the event, and then what kind of event this is (the demo has 3 examples) - it then adjusts the time to add an appropriate length for the appointment and adds it to my calendar. This is very useful because I can never remember what floor my dentist is on or exactly where to turn to find my hairdresser - so I can add this to the notes. Even if the places you frequent are not hidden like mine are you can still use this! You can get the workflow here: Calendar Event Templates Make sure to read on to find out about the \"Run Workflow\" action at the end of it.Workflow: Add Event To Work Calendar This workflow follows the first one, and is in fact run by it - or could be. It simply asks you if the appointment you've made is during working hours, and if you say yes, adds an event that starts half an hour before and ends half an hour after the appointment you've just created to your calendar. Make sure to tweak the calendar setting here! You can get the workflow here: Add Event To Work Calendar (Menu) Of course, you can automate this too, this formats the date of the event as one letter (so Monday becomes M, Friday becomes F), and if it's not Saturday or Sunday, checks if the event starts after 8 am but before 6pm - if yes it adds an event to your calendar. It's not insanely complicated, but it's not as simple as the Workflow above. You can get the workflow here: Add Event To Work Calendar (Auto)David's Hyper Scheduling Workflow Since February David has had an ongoing Hyper-Scheduling Experiment, which involves scheduling blocks of time in his calendar to provide a framework throughout his day. You can see his Workflow to generate some of the core blocks here.https://youtu.be/mRDUdsRBiIk You can get the workflow here: Block ScheduleAdd Travel Time Here David walks you through how his Workflow to add travel time events to your calendar works.https://youtu.be/Do6UWlnO_5g You can get the workflow here: Travel TimeRepeating Events Of course, one of the simplest ways to automate calendar event creation is repeats - and you can go from very simple up to fairly complex within that. The simplest repeats are every day/week/month/year, but if you go into the Custom... options then you can create repeats such as \"On the first weekday of every month\".   Copy and paste If repeating events count as automation (they do!) then copying and pasting events does as well.   CMD+D allows you to duplicate an event, and then you can drag  and drop it.    CMD+C and then CMD+V lets you paste, if you select  a new date before you paste then the event is automatically added to that  day. In many apps you can even paste it in at the time you have selected.    Fantastical on iOS gives you the option to duplicate an event when you tap  and hold on it, or when you swipe, and tap \"More...\", BusyCal allows you to  duplicate an event by force touching it. I personally prefer Fantastical as  it immediately asks me for the new date where as with BusyCal you need to  edit the new event.  Workflow: Copy a Calendar Event This Workflow lets you choose from calendar events, and uses the chosen item to create a new event. It is currently set to use events from today, but you can easily change the filter in the \"Find Calendar Events\" action to look in the last week, the next week, or any time period of your choice.https://youtu.be/BNYbLxzKx2M  You can get the workflow here: Copy Calendar EventParsing a list of events with Numbers I first mentioned this automation in episode 418 of the Mac Power Users, this is designed to help you take a list of events and quickly add them to the right calendars. As David mentioned on the podcast you could also use it to calculate dates backwards from a specific event (he used a trial as an example) to add other events or deadlines to your calendar.https://youtu.be/tvlrZpEklbw You can download the spreadsheet here. The Keyboard Maestro Macro is very simple, it splits the text on your clipboard into lines, and then runs the following AppleScript on each line.tell application \"Keyboard Maestro Engine\" to set myEvent to getvariable \"Event\"tell application \"Fantastical 2\"  parse sentence myEvent with add immediatelyend tell This AppleScript merely sets a local variable to the Keyboard Maestro variable for the line, and then uses Fantastical's AppleScript support to get it to parse the event and add it straight to your calendar. If you wanted to evaluate each event before it gets added then you would remove the with add immediately.  You can download this Keyboard Maestro Macro here  You can also make this system iOS friendly in two ways, the Numbers sheet itself of course works on iOS. But you can do two things with the list of events it generates, the first is to use a Workflow, Clipboard Events To Fantastical which goes through all the lines on your clipboard adding them to Fantastical for you. The second way is to use Drafts, with the Events in Fantastical action provided by Agile Tortoise. As mentioned in the show, David has a great series of video tutorials for Fantastical where he guides you through the core features and some of the syntax options.Adding event with AppleScript As we mentioned in the show, AppleScript is not the most flexible when it comes to adding events to your calendar. However it is definitely possible! I highly recommend the official Apple documentation as a starting point for a script that works, There's also a library called CalendarLib which is linked on the very helpful macosautomation.com. Of course, you can also use AppleScript to control Fantastical - as demonstrated in my Keyboard Maestro Macro above, here's their documentation for integration with other apps.Cloud Based Automation Using web services like IFTTT or Zapier to automate things based on calendar events can be limited if you're not using the \"right\" calendar system - so you can have IFTTT trigger things based on an event starting in Google calendar, but not in iCloud calendar. You can however use a variety of triggers from time and date, to RSS feed entries, to add events to your calendar on almost any system - as long as if it's iCloud you have the IFTTT app installed.Favourite Workflows In this last part of the show we talked about our two favourite automations related to calendars.David - Meeting Confirmation  This workflow is really useful if you have meetings that you need to remind other people of, David actually has two - one for in person meetings, and one for scheduled calls. You can get them here:   Meeting Confirmation    Phone Confirmation Rose - Workflow: Event Review I use this Workflow to help me review the events that have happened in the last week, as well as to prepare tasks for appointments in the upcoming week. This adds the calendar events from last week to a Drafts note, and combines any tasks you note down for the next week into Taskpaper and adds them to Omnifocus.

Unfortunately the almost for most people is a deal breaker - but I'm stubborn and see these things as a problem to be solved rather than a reason to use another device!One of my most frequently used \"tools\" are servers - if you can call a server a tool. This blog runs on one, as does Automation Orchard, as well as a lot of little scripts which make my life easier. Unfortunately having an entire server running locally on an iPad isn't quite possible yet - apps like DraftCode Offline PHP IDE are fabulous and can even run Wordpress - but sometimes needs must, and you need something that is less restricted. This is where my Raspberry Pi Zero W comes into play.The Raspberry Pi Zero W, for those of you not familiar with it, is an extremely small headless computer - it doesn't have a screen - indeed when you buy it you just get the board, that's it! The hard drive is a micro SD card, and it sports a few ports - 2 micro USB (one for power), and a mini HDMI. How on earth can you connect to that with an iPad?The answer is not the shortest or easiest, but it does sound simple: wifi. I have set my Raspberry Pi up so that when it boots up it creates a wifi network, of course this doesn't create an internet connection, but that's not what we're after here. I won't go into the steps of setting this up here, instead I recommend you follow this guide: Setting Up a Raspberry Pi as an Access Point in a Standalone Network (NAT)The other part I needed to do was to make sure the Pi would always have the same IP address. This allows me to use use Workflow to control it via SSH, and connect to it with Coda which lets me hook right into the device and has great syntax highlighting. As I mostly program for the web with PHP I use Coda in split screen with Safari which I can refresh to see the results of what I'm doing.I use a CMS called Grav, and they have a nice little guide to help you set up the Raspberry Pi to run it - there are guides to set up most CMS on a Pi if you look.Why would I do all of this over using something like Linode or Digital Ocean, you might ask. It's a very simple answer: internet isn't always a given. I travel a lot, and most of my flights do not have wifi (and those that do charge a fortune for it). Even trains go through tunnels where you lose your connection. If you always have wifi or cellular data then you can avoid carrying a tiny computer, cable and battery pack along with your iPad, but if you don't then this is a very small combination that gives you a lot of power.Hardware in use:Raspberry Pi Zero WPibow Zero WAnker PowerCoreAnker PowerLine Micro USB (4 Inches)You'll also need a microSD card and to set up the OS on it, if you're not sure where to begin you can buy one with NOOBS preinstalled.","url":"/blog/my-raspberry-pi-zero-w-portable-development-server/","excerpt":"<p>I love my iPad, it's a great, very portable device that I can use for almost everything.

Being a nerd I want to make this as easy as possible for myself, whilst still being accurate - and the simplest way to do this is to use software to manage my references.After doing some comparisons I settled on Zotero - it's free, which is perfect for a student budget, and you could program your own extensions if needed. More importantly it has a Word plugin which as I am required to submit my assignments in Word format is extremely useful.For those of you not familiar with referencing plugins and software you usually write your essay, and as you get to a place where you would insert a citation then you use the plugin in Word to do so. This software later generates a complete bibliography for you. EndNote, Mendeley, Bookends and Zotero are all capable of handling different citation formats, and Zotero even has one for my university's exact styling which is a great timesaver.At the start of each course or module I save all of the recommended reading into Zotero, they have browser plugins for Safari, Firefox, and Chrome which is ideal. By default Zotero saves PDFs if one is available for the reference, or a web snapshot. I prefer to save these items to DevonThink so use DevonThink's plugin to save the actual files to it instead. When saving the files I use the format Author - year - title which makes it easy to find the relevant reference. DevonThink allows me to use Edit in Place on iOS to annotate documents with whichever app I like. I also prefer to save web pages in PDF form which means I can annotate everything with PDF Expert.To remove these attachments from my Zotero library (you only get 200MB of sync storage for free), I have created a saved search. It has Item Type is Attachment as the sole criteria, and searches the whole library. I simply open this saved search, use CMD+A, and press delete - which deletes all of my attachments. As I prefer to use the search in DevonThink to find references I remember this isn't a problem, and I can also use the NEAR search parameter (NEAR(man, cat) would find items where the word man is within 10 words of the word cat, you can expand on this with NEAR(man, cat, 100) which would do the same but within 100 words - this is a massive timesaver for me.Sometimes items added to Zotero do not always have the complete metadata - this tends to be my university website in my case. To fix these items I have a very useful smart folder and Keyboard Maestro Macro. The smart folder filters for items from my university website, which have no date or creator, the keyboard maestro macro requires me to set the number of items it should process and then goes through and uses the \"click at image\" action to set both the author and the date of the item in question. Zotero does have an API, but sometimes the best automation is the one you can set up the fastest which achieves the needed results - and this certainly fits that bill.DevonThink and Zotero are a very useful pair for me and I honestly think that without them I would struggle to complete my assignments.","url":"/blog/managing-references-and-resources-when-writing-academic-papers/","excerpt":"<p>Some of you may know that I'm studying for my Masters degree in Computing (Software Engineering), this naturally requires me to write more than a few essays with full referencing.

I travel a fair amount, and often to more than one destination so this is built around that.The first thing I do is decide where I'm going and when I'll go there. Then the Workflow puts together the start of a \"before I go\" list - including entries such as booking time off work, booking flights, charging battery packs, etc. The next step is to choose if this is a one or a multiple destination trip, if it's just one location then I add a few entries for that - planning travel to and from the airport, things to do, and so on. If it's a multi destination trip then I have to tell the app which places I'm going and in what order, and it generates a series of tasks based on that. The last thing the template does is to add packing categories to my project, I keep my actual packing lists in TripList as it has a wizard which generates a list for me (I could replicate that in Workflow of course!) - and syncs things to my TripIt plans.The taskpaper result for a one destination trip looks like this:2018/08 - Belgium:  - Book time off work 11/08/2018 - 14/08/2018  - Book flights to Belgium  - Plan travel to the airport for 11/08/2018  - Plan travel home from the airport for 14/08/2018  - Make a packing list  - Pack  - Charge battery pack  - Charge headphones  - Put films &amp; TV shows on iPad  - Book accommodation for Belgium  - Plan travel from the airport to accommodation (11/08/2018)  - Plan travel from the accommodation to the airport (14/08/2018)  - Plan things to do in Belgium  - Packing    - Clothing    - Documents    - Electronics    - Miscellaneous    - Hand luggageAnd for a multiple destination trip you end up with this:2018/08 - Belgium / Netherlands:  - Book time off work 11/08/2018 - 18/08/2018  - Book flights to Belgium  - Plan travel to the airport for 11/08/2018  - Plan travel home from the airport for 18/08/2018  - Make a packing list  - Pack  - Charge battery pack  - Charge headphones  - Put films &amp; TV shows on iPad  - Belgium @autodone(true) @parallel(true)    - Book accommodation for Belgium    - Plan travel from the airport to accommodation    - Plan things to do in Belgium  - Netherlands @autodone(true) @parallel(true)    - Plan travel from Belgium to Netherlands (14/08/2018)    - Book accommodation for Netherlands    - Plan things to do in Netherlands  - Packing    - Clothing    - Documents    - Electronics    - Miscellaneous    - Hand luggageAs you can see there's not much of a difference - just the division and repetition of some tasks.You can get the workflow here: OmniFocus Travel PlansIf you look at that Workflow and think that it's too complicated and I'm crazy (possible), then I also have a simple version for one destination which you can get here: OmniFocus Travel Plans - Simple","url":"/blog/omnifocus-travel-plans/","excerpt":"<p><a href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-travel-plans/workflow-omnifocus-travel-plans.png\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/06/workflow-omnifocus-travel-plans.png\" width=\"192\" height=\"192\" /></a>Another Workflow workflow I demonstrated in my <a href=\"https://inside.omnifocus.com/rose-orchard/?ref=16\">Learn OmniFocus Video</a> was one to generate a project for travel.

The project will already exist as I have to register for the course, and potentially order course materials or communicate with the course professors before I get the syllabus. Each of my courses is separated into action groups - sometimes the courses divide their materials into weekly blocks, and sometimes they're divided into blocks based on assessments. I always put assessments in their own blocks, because they are broken into sub sections as well.This workflow should add each section of work or assessment to OmniFocus as an action group, deferred and due as is appropriate. As such the first thing it does after I input the project name (which is the class name) is to ask me how many sections there are in the course. We then go through every section inputting the name of it. If I know that the course is split into weeks then I modify this action in advance to just use \"Week Repeat Index\" as the name of the section. I use the start and end dates to set due and defer dates, and then select if this section is to study something or to submit something (study or assignment). This is a menu which allows me to use different actions based on which option is selected.In the study section, I input the tasks and format them as taskpaper. In the assignment section I input the name of the assignment and the number of questions it has which generates subtasks for me.This whole Workflow generates TaskPaper and adds it to OmniFocus for me.Steps:Ask for Input: The course name (which is the project name in OmniFocus)Ask for Input: How many sections or blocks does the course have?Repeat: Going through every section/blockAsk for Input: The name of the sectionAsk for Input: The start dateAsk for Input: The end dateChoose from Menu: Is this a study or assignment section/blockStudyAsk for Input: Input the tasks which need to be completed.Split Text: Break up the lines of tasksRepeat with Each: For every taskText: Format it with a tab indent and the - used to indicate a task in TaskPaperCombine Text: Put these tasks back together with line breaks between them,Text: Format the action group here, with the defer and due dates (these are inherited), followed by the tasks which were input and formatted.AssignmentAsk for Input:Ask for Input:Repeat with Each: For every taskText: Format it with a tab indent and the - used to indicate a task in TaskPaperCombine Text: Put these tasks back together with line breaks between them,Text: Format the action group here, with the name of the assignment, defer date and due date and the questions as subtasks.Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus: Put everything we've generated above into OmniFocus.You can get the workflow here: OmniFocus University Course","url":"/blog/workflow-omnifocus-university-course-template/","excerpt":"<p><a href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-omnifocus-university-course-template/workflow-omnifocus-university-course.png\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/06/workflow-omnifocus-university-course.png\" width=\"92\" height=\"92\" /></a>I was asked to talk through my thought process behind a Workflow by <em>powderizedbookworm</em> in the OmniFocus Slack, so this post will go into more detail than usual.</p>\n"},{"id":"blog-the-mac-quadcast-ep-interview-with-rose-orchard","title":"The Mac Quadcast - Ep. 4 (Interview with Rose Orchard)","categories":null,"tags":[],"content":"I was Darren's guest on the MacQuadCast where we talked about everything from AirPods to iPods, and our favourite devices as well as entertainment.Listen on The MacQuadCast","url":"/blog/the-mac-quadcast-ep-interview-with-rose-orchard/","excerpt":"<p>I was Darren's guest on the MacQuadCast where we talked about everything from AirPods to iPods, and our favourite devices as well as entertainment.</p>\n"},{"id":"blog-juuk-rainbow-watch-strap","title":"Review: Juuk Rainbow Watch Strap","categories":null,"tags":[],"content":"A while ago I ordered a rainbow watch strap. Not just any rainbow watch strap, but an aluminium link, Apple Watch strap. I came across a purple link watch strap on Reddit months ago, fell in love and then was immensely disappointed it had sold out. I did spot the rainbow strap on the same website though, and immediately put it on my wish list. Since then the rainbow strap has been in the back of my mind - I dislike buckles on watches, which is why I never tried to get the Apple Pride strap despite loving the idea and colour combination. Similarly, I've never owned a link strap for my Apple Watch. My wrists are small, so unless the strap comes with an adjuster tool, it often ends up being comically large. Juuk ships all of their watch straps with an adjuster tool, and the video guides for adjustment didn't look too hard to follow either - I decided to give it a whirl.I paid for fast shipping, and shipping was fast. I ordered May 1st; it was delivered May 5th. Of course, postage depends a lot on the postal services are involved and handover time - but it's safe to say I'm impressed. The watch was in an envelope, in a box - in a box. Good packaging so you could give the strap as a gift, and the recipient would be delighted. https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/outer-box.jpg? \"Outer box, brown cardboard\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/inner-box.jpg? \"Inner box, white with a picture of the strap on it and the Juuk logo at the top\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/strap-in-box.jpg? \"The strap in the box, in grey foam. There's a silver bar at the top and more foam above that.\")Inside the box in a box, was the watch strap. Nicely presented in specially cut out foam. I didn't realise to start with the metal bar at the top is the adjustment tool - with its own piece of foam on it to prevent you hurting yourself. The way it is laid out makes it look high quality - and it is too. The strap itself has some heft to it - and you would expect it to. But being aluminium rather than steel it's not that heavy, making it comfortable to wear all day. Every link is a different colour graduating through the rainbow from the watch face on both sides, and it is designed so that one side has one more link than the other - to make it easier for you to put on and take off I presume, the idea being the shorter side brings the butterfly closure closer to the inside of your wrist. An extra nice touch is the last link above the closure has Juuk engraved into it, it't not highlighted in any colour and if you weren't looking for it you might miss it. I dislike wearing advertisements for brands unwillingly - but should I forget where I purchased this band (unlikely) I will still be able to see it and let people know.https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/adjustment-tool.jpg?\" alt=\"The adjustment tool, a aluminium bar, with three points of varying heights to allow you to pop out the pins\">Adjusting the watch strap was as easy as the video says. Make sure you don't put your fingers on the top of the pin you're trying to pop out, and I would personally have a small tray (such as the lid from a tube of Pringles) ready to put the pin and pin casings in. Unless you do this sort of thing regularly or have another strap to compare to for length you're going to have to adjust this with trial and error. I thought I had it adjusted perfectly, only to decide 20 minutes later that an extra link would be preferable - so keep the adjustment tool handy. There are extra This is the first link strap I've bought that I can wear (I haven't managed to get the other one linked above adjusted yet), and it takes some getting used to. Putting it on the watch requires a little more coordination than I'm used to, as Milanese and sport loops are floppy and flexible, and the sport bands are of course two pieces - that's not a criticism of this band though, I went to the Apple Store to play and all the link straps are like that. I have found it's easiest to put both sides on at the same time now. https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/all-the-links-too-big.jpg? \"The strap as it arrived, with all the links and much too big\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/removed-links-just-right.jpg? \"After removing the links the strap fits very well\")I love this strap, it's fun, comfortable, nice quality, and easy to wear. It's not cheap, but it's much cheaper than the Apple ones. For people not into rainbow they also have a variety of solid colours, and even ones with a raised stripe/bar down the middle that remind me of racing cars. Some straps are available on Amazon, but the Juuk website has the full range and excellent customer service should you have any questions.","url":"/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/","excerpt":"<p>A while ago I ordered a rainbow watch strap.

If you want to see a video of my setup you can do so over on Learn OmniFocus, there's also an article on how I've been using OF3 over on Inside OmniFocus. Finally you might want to check on my OmniFocus Sneak Peak - though that was back in March and more than a few things have changed since then!Multi-Pane ModeMy favourite feature has to be the multi pane view, being able to see 3 columns at once makes me happy, and it works exceptionally well on the 12.9\" iPad Pro. You can choose to pin the sidebar and the inspector independently of one another or together, so you can have a 2 pane view if that's what you need. The outline view is always shown on the iPad.TagsTags, glorious tags. What used to be contexts has been renamed, and that opens up all sorts of possibilities. I've seen people experimenting with energy levels, I'm personally experimenting with \"time of day\" tags, and you can go as crazy as you like. Where tags are really paying off for me is being able to add both \"waiting on\" and \"Person A\" to a task - so whenever I check my agenda for \"Person A\" I see that I'm waiting on that task, as well as seeing it in my waiting on list.PerspectivesPerspectives are where everything is different. All your perspectives have been migrated over from OmniFocus 2, and you can upgrade those to OmniFocus 3 perspectives which gives you the following options:StatusDue SoonFlaggedAvailabilityFirst AvailableAvailableRemainingCompletedHas a due dateHas a defer dateHas an estimated durationHas an estimated duration less than5 minutes15 minutes30 minutes60 minutesIs untaggedHas a tag whichIs activeIs on holdIs droppedIs active and has available actionsIs active and has no available actionsIs tagged with any ofIs tagged with all ofIs not a project or groupIs in the inboxHas a project whichIs active or on holdIs on holdHas been completedHas been droppedIs active and has available actionsIs active and has no available actionsIs active and has a future defer dateIs contained within a project or folderMatches search termsAll of the followingAny of the followingNone of the followingThe best part of perspectives is being able to add as many rules as you like. The top level is always \"All of the following\", and then you start adding rules within that. You can also add \"Any of the following\", \"None of the following\" and \"All of the following\" and add rules inside of those - useful for requiring a group of rules (e.g. flagged and has Tag X), or setting optional groups. I have a \"Now\" perspective which changes all the time, and I tap the rule above my Work folder to change it to \"All of the following\" to \"None of the following\" depending on if I'm at work or not.Batch EditingBeing able to edit more than one task at once is not a feature I need frequently, but it is one I really appreciate when I use it. You can enable it by tapping the \"Edit\" button in the top right, and then selecting multiple tasks. You can access the task inspector in the batch edit mode, and it will show you all of the properties which are the same, and a greyed out option where they're different. If I selected two tasks, one had a due date of today and one with tomorrow, I could still set a new due date for both items at the same time though. You can also use CMD+A to select all the tasks in the current view if you have an external keyboard attached - very useful if your inbox was empty, you added a lot of tasks and then realised they should have been in a project instead!Custom RepeatsI love repeating tasks, my problem is my repeating tasks aren't all that regular (at least most of them), thankfully I can handle this in OmniFocus 3. You can set repeats with an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly interval, but you can also say \"every Tuesday and Saturday\", or \"the first Wednesday of every month\", or \"the last day of every month\". This has made submitting my work timesheets much easier to remember.NotificationsSome tasks are very important, so important you want flashing lights, sirens, and people in hazmat suits running around if the deadline gets too close. In the main settings you can specify notifications for due dates and defer dates globally, and these can also be enabled or removed on each task. You are also able to set two extra kinds of notifications - ones relative to the due date, and ones at a specific date and time. These reminders are a great help with those crucial tasks - if you need someone with a hazmat suit though you're on your own.Customisable InspectorSome people love defer dates, some people hate them. Some people don't want notifications or repeats, for others those are on every task. In OmniFocus 3 you can choose which properties you want to see by default in the inspector - just open up a task, tag or project and tap \"Customize Inspector\" at the bottom to move the items you want to where you want them to be.ForecastThe forecast has changed a lot in OmniFocus 3, there are two major changes which I'll look at here.Interleaved Events &amp; Due ItemsCalendar events are interleaved with due items in your day. Instead of the gantt chart style event display in in OF2 (which at least for me wasn't very helpful), they are nice big blocks which show which calendar they're on, when they start and when they end. If you have a meeting 9am-10am, and then a due date at 10:30 that's the order you'll see your tasks in.Forecast TagYou can now choose a task to display in the forecast view, this is ideal for things like routine tasks, a sprint at work (a series of tasks or projects to be completed within a specific time period), or errands. You can choose different forecast tags per device, so on your iPhone you might choose calls or errands, but on your iPad it could be \"secret nerdy tasks\".There are a lot of big changes in OmniFocus 3, and based on the roadmap there will be a lot more to come, but first of all we have WWDC and the Mac app to look forward to!","url":"/blog/omnifocus-3-overview/","excerpt":"<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1346190318?at=1010lumu\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/omnifocus.png\" width=\"171\" height=\"171\" /></a>¬†<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1346190318?at=1010lumu\">OmniFocus 3</a> for iOS is here, and there's more than a few changes!

Then it takes all of these items and puts them in your OmniFocus Inbox.I've uploaded two \"flavours\" of this Workflow, one where the trigger word is noted after the task in brackets, and the other where the trigger word becomes the parent task of an action group, with your triggered tasks inside of it.Trigger word in bracketsAction groups with the trigger word as the parent taskIf you need some inspiration for your trigger list the official GTD Trigger Lists are a great place to start - and there are trigger list examples all over the internet.One enhancement you might make is to have more than one of these workflows - one at home, and one at work. You could also trigger the Workflow to run at a specific time with Launch Center Pro - I do this as it's one of my tasks which kicks off my weekly review.

What about a dictionary? If you're not a programmer and have had little experience with writing for computers in general then this can be a little overwhelming.ListsA list is exactly what it sounds like. You have a list of items, and you can choose from them or get a specific item (at an index, so the 1st or 5th item for example). A list gives you what you choose - so if you have a list of animals, when you choose \"Cat\" you get \"Cat\" - fairly simple.You can make lists in a few ways, if you Add to Variable you can get that variable and use Choose from List. You can also Split Text and then Choose from List again. There is also the list action you can add items to - and you follow it with a Choose from List action again.MenusA menu is a list of items which contain actions - this is ideal if you want to be able to do different things based on the option chosen (e.g. reminder vs calendar event vs note). You don't get the text of the menu item after you click it, though you can work around this by using the Text action if you need it.DictionariesA dictionary is somewhere between a list and a menu in many ways. If I choose \"Spaghetti Bolognese\" then a dictionary can return \"ground beef, tomatoes, onion, spaghetti...\". This can have all sorts of applications - and Workflow actually gives you dictionaries a lot of the time when you put the Choose from List action after another, such as Search App Store.Dictionaries can really help improve your Workflow experience. Maybe you want to have a simple list of people, and when you select one you get that person's phone number - or maybe you want to get complicated and go crazy. That's all possible with dictionaries.A dictionary is a series of keys and values. The key is what you choose, and the value is what you get. There are multiple ways to make dictionaries in Workflow - the simplest way though is to use the Dictionary action.Tips and tricksYou can order lists, menus, and dictionaries manually using the grab handles on the side of their action blocks. But a list or dictionary can also be sorted by its key using the Filter files action. You can use this to sort the keys alphabetically. This won't change the list or the dictionary in your editing view, but it will change before you choose or get an item from it.","url":"/blog/workflow-menus-lists-dictionaries/","excerpt":"<p>When should you use a list or a menu.

I have chosen Carrot weather, because the weather in Vienna tends to stay somewhat stable throughout the day, this means I can turn off the Weather source in the watch face. What is limiting is that 3rd party app developers can't integrate into the Siri face - at least not directly. I have managed to get my OmniFocus data into it though - by subscribing to my OmniFocus calendar on my iPhone. This calendar is hidden, and does have the unfortunate side effect of giving me an extra notification when each task is due if I let it get that far - but for me the trade off is well worth it. You can manage the calendars shown on your Apple Watch in the Watch app, under Calendars.

This is the last but one action in the action group - the reasoning being you're not likely to need it as often as some of the others! It simply opens a new Drafts with the format set to taskpaper - you can do this yourself by tapping the + icon if you're in a Draft, and then using the Aa button to set the Syntax Highlighting of the current draft to Taskpaper.The first action in the group is a tab, this is for iPhone users and iPad users without an external keyboard and it simply inserts a tab wherever the cursor currently is.The next action is Placeholder, if you have text selected it will wrap the text in ¬´¬ª characters, and if no text is selected it will insert them. This is ideal for dates in templates you will want to update later.The first Due action takes advantage of the natural language parsing that OmniFocus has available via URL Scheme. Again, if you have text selected it will wrap it in @due(), otherwise that will be inserted empty for you to fill in the brackets.The Defer, Estimate, Tags, and Context actions work the same way as Due. Tags and context are both available so if you're on the OmniFocus 3 beta or simply want to prepare your templates to work for both 2 and 3 you can already.Tags (suggest) offers a list of tags for you to choose from, allows you to choose more than one of them, and inserts them inside @tag(). You will need to edit this script to make it work for you - the \"one\", \"two\", \"three\" is the part that needs changing. Bear in mind that a long list of tags will be annoying to look through most likely. If you want any tags to be pre-selected for you (e.g. you usually add the evening tag to tasks created via Drafts), you can put that into the [] after the tag list.Autodone asks you if you want the task or project to be automatically completed when the tasks inside of it are completed and inserts @autodone(true) or @autodone(false)as per your choice.The Repeat Method allows you to choose how the task should repeat, and inserts @repeat-method(fixed), or whichever the relevant choice is.The Repeat Rule is very simple, but allows you to choose if a task should be repeated every X days, weeks, months, or years.Parallel works the same way Autodone does, if the project should be parallel (actions able to be worked on at the same time) then @parallel(true) is inserted, if not @parallel(false) appears.Flagged just inserts @flagged when it is run - which adds a flag to a task.Due and Defer are here again - but this time with date and time pickers. This allows you to choose an exact date and time when your task or project is due. I've used European date formatting, but you can modify that to any other date formatting by replacing the \"dd-MM-yyyy hh:mm\" (for example in North America you might prefer \"MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm\").Estimate makes another appearance, this time it asks you to choose how many minutes, hours, days or weeks something will take and fills in the @estimate() for you.The final action in this set is Taskpaper to OF. This will ask you where you want to save your Draft (as a new project, a new project in a folder, as tasks in a specifc project, or the inbox), go through any ¬´placeholders¬ª you have and help you replace them (important cat is always going to be replaced with whatever you tell the script when it asks you about it, so make sure you to use unique placeholders where necessary!), and then send everything off to OmniFocus. Once you return if it did have placeholders to replace it offers to make a new Draft, update your current Draft, or do nothing.This action group is set up as a keyboard group, which should make quick entry easier.

Why? Sometimes that message turns into an email, or maybe the quick idea turns into a mind map. Or maybe you just don‚Äôt know where the text is going to end up when you start writing. Drafts is designed to let you write and then process the text, removing the need to choose where the text should go first.When you open Drafts you get a blank note - automatically. You can set the time out period so that when you return to Drafts you either see your last note or a new note - mine is set to the default of 60 seconds. You can also open the app with force touch which allows you to create a new blank note, create a note from the clipboard, dictate a note, search, or open any one of your 4 most recently edited Drafts. The first three of these options, plus the choice to import a file, appear when you force touch the + on an iPhone, or press and hold on an iPad. The great part about the dictation is that unlike regular Siri dictation there‚Äôs no timeout, that‚Äôs right - you can dictate for as long as you like. David Sparks made a great introduction to Drafts 5 which I highly recommend: Drafts 5 Overview What Changed?Some of you may have used Drafts before, in fact if you‚Äôre reading this it‚Äôs likely you have so what‚Äôs new? First of all the app has been completely rewritten, this means everything is new and shiny - and 100% up to date. There's also lots of new features.First things first, you can import all of your notes to Drafts and most of your actions. Make sure you're running the latest version of Drafts 4, and then in the settings of Drafts 5, tap \"Migrate from Drafts 4\". You can choose to import your Drafts, and/or Actions and Keys. You can also export from Drafts 4 into Drafts 5 - there's a special Send to Drafts 5 for drafts, and inside each action in Drafts 4 you can choose to migrate the action, or add it as a callback so when the action is executed it is done so in Drafts 4 and then returns you to Drafts 5. Not every action which was available in Drafts 4 is available yet in Drafts 5, but Drafts 5 will make a list of the actions that couldn't be imported so you can handle those manually.ThemesDrafts 4 had three theme choices - white, cream and black - and the ability to automatically switch to the black theme at a certain brightness threshold. Drafts 5 has several more colour theme options, and you can specify a day theme and a night theme to work with, which will switch at the brightness level you prefer. Choose the theme is a pro feature, and I've really enjoyed using the dark Solarized theme during the day with black at night.Custom IconsChoosing app icons is definitely a nice way to make your device yours, and Drafts now offers the ability to choose your app icon. There's a mix of flat images and ones with gradients - I personally picked the purple as that's my favourite colour.Tagging and FlaggingTagging allows you to optionally file your note in multiple places - and helps you to group together notes on a particular topic as well. Tags are shown under a draft in the list of drafts. When adding a tag to a draft you can see a list of your current tags in the keyboard bar, if the one you are looking for doesn't exist then you can type to create it. Tags are lower case - you can type capitals when creating them but they will be formatted for you. This is really useful as it allows you to avoid having Groceries and groceries by accident.Flagging is simple - a draft is flagged, or it is not flagged. You can use it however makes the most sense to you.FilteringNow we have filters we need to be able to work with them. Filtering allows us to choose combinations of tags to see or not as we want. By tapping the name of a tag in the filter section we add it to include, and by tapping the (ban) icon we can add the tag to the omitted list. This means you could include the tags cat and dog, but disallow spider. These tags are combined with an AND, so only drafts with all of the included tags and none of the omitted tags will show up.Tags are not the only settings however, you can also set how much of a draft you want to see in the list, the sort order, if flagged items should be included or not, specific text to search for and more.¬†The full documentation for filtering in Drafts is well worth reading.WorkspacesWorkspaces can be created in two ways, from a filter you are currently using, or from scratch. They have the same set up as filters, but as you can name them and set the colour and icon to represent they are easy to keep track of. You can set the order that you would like to view your Workspaces in, and optionally show them, with or without their name, at the bottom of the list of Drafts. Workspaces are ideal for filters you make frequently, or which are more complex to construct. FocusBy default Drafts will open to a new draft after a set period of time - which can be adjusted by you. Focus mode allows you to do that by focusing on one particular draft, this means that whenever you open the app - even if that's next month - you'll be back at the draft you had open last. You can enable focus mode in two ways, by tapping the eye icon in the bottom left hand side of the editor when you're not editing a draft, or by opening the Settings and enabling it.SiriKit IntegrationHey Siri, make a note in Drafts to investigate buying the llama farmYou can now create new Drafts using Siri, it's simple but effective. You can also dictate notes, but that's not new - what's very useful though is that the dictation will not end as it does usually when dictating elsewhere on iOS.Editor OptionsIn Drafts you can now control a lot of settings with regards to how the editor appears, from paragraph numbers to syntax highlighting, and even whether or not the toolbar or the status bar should show you have plenty of choices.Here are some of the options you can choose to set for the editor by tapping the Aa button:Syntax highlightingPlain textMarkdownSimple ListTaskpaperJavaScriptFontChoose from any of the fonts pre-installed on iOS, or ones you have installed yourself.Select a particular font to use for Monospaced text.Line heightParagraph spacingMarginsParagraph numbersYou can enable or disableAutocorrectSpell checkSmart punctuationQuotesDashesCapitalisationNone or sentencesPortrait, landscape, or any (only on iPhone)Draft 5 also has an improved arrange mode, Drafts 4 just allowed you to rearrange lines, Drafts 5 lets you edit blocks (separated by two line breaks) or lines, edit sections, and delete or remove them. You can also trigger the arrange mode via the URL scheme.There is also a pre-installed Tasks action, which is shown on your keyboard by default. This is very clever, it makes the line that you're on or the text you have selected into a simple bullet checklist by adding - [ ] at the beginning of the line. By tapping on the [ ] you can mark a task as done [x].¬†Actions and Keyboard GroupsFor those of you familiar with Workflow, actions are very similar in some ways. An action can contain any number of steps, a number of which are provided for you to use as is. Drafts does not arrive empty, it comes with 5 example action groups, 4 of which are available as keyboard groups for you - you can do what you like with these actions, including delete them. But if you're not familiar with Drafts and it's actions I recommend you swipe across the action from left to write, tap edit, and have a look.One important change between Drafts 4 and Drafts 5 is there is no longer an app wide default as to what to do once an action has been executed, you now set this per action group. This is very useful so if you have a group of \"share\" actions for example, designed to get the text out of Drafts, you could immediately have the draft the action was executed on archived or trashed as you prefer.You can choose to enable an action group on the keyboard, Draft has a row of buttons above the keyboard, and if you have multiple groups of keyboard actions you can swipe up and down on this row to switch between them. As you can assign keyboard shortcuts to actions as well this becomes very powerful very quickly.Scripting in DraftsThe most powerful part of Drafts actions is the Script action, this is what it sounds like - you write a script which does things. Drafts uses JavaScript, if you use OmniGroup products they are introducing JavaScript for automation in those too - so learning the language could definitely pay off in the long run.There is a wiki about Drafts scripting, which is definitely worth reading if you intend to use them.My favourite functions that can be included in Scripting is the Prompt - so if you want to ask the user \"cats or dogs\", you could create a prompt which shows \"cats\" and \"dogs\" as buttons, and then depending on which they choose your script would react accordingly. A prompt can have any of the following optionsTitleMessageText FieldsDate and or Time FieldsSelects - single or multiple choiceButtonsHere's the script to create that prompt:var p = Prompt.create();p.title = \"Title\";p.message = \"Message\";p.addTextField(\"myTextField\", \"Text Field\", \"\");p.addDatePicker(\"myDate\", \"Date Field\", new Date(), { \"mode\": \"date\"});p.addDatePicker(\"myTime\", \"Time Field\", new Date(), { \"mode\": \"time\"});p.addDatePicker(\"myDateTime\", \"Date &amp; Time Field\", new Date(), { \"mode\": \"dateAndTime\"});p.addSelect(\"mySingleSelect\", \"Single Select Field\", [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Llama\"], [], false);p.addSelect(\"myMultipleSelect\", \"Multiple Select Field\", [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Llama\"], [], true);p.addButton(\"Button\");p.show();The cancel button is in a prompt by default, but you can hide it if you wish. The prompt will definitely make an appearance in actions you import from the action directory - if only because it's a great way to get credentials from you which can be used in an action.CredentialsIf you want to Tweet with Drafts, save something to Evernote, or add tasks to Todoist, there are two ways to do that. Passing the data to the app on your device and telling it what to do - which is not possible with every app - or by using the API of the service to complete the action. The difficulty with an API is you need a token to access it - similar to needing a username and password to log in. Drafts 5 has a clever way to store these, so that scripts can access them without needing to save the access key in the script itself - so there's no worry that by sharing your Todoist action people can start adding things to your Todoist, unless you explicitly want them to do so and share your credential! You can change the credentials saved in Drafts by tapping on the Settings wheel in the bottom right of the editor, and opening Credentials. By choosing the \"forget\" option the credential is deleted, and you can input a new one the next time you run an action that needs it. This system is especially useful as you can share one credential with many scripts - so it doesn't matter if you have 1 or 100 Todoist scripts, they can all access the same key, and you are in charge of it. The documentation for credentials in scripts is definitely worth reading if you want to access APIs, and the general documentation is also very helpful - especially if you have multiple accounts you want to interact with.¬†PriceDrafts 5 is free. Yes, you read that correctly. For the basic functionality you can get the app for free. If you want to create and edit your own actions, choose your theme(s) and custom icon, use Workspaces, have access to enhanced URL automation and support development you can do so for $1.99 a month, or $19.99 a year. If you're not sure which you need then there is a 7 day trial to let you play with the pro features.David Sparks (MacSparky) made a second video for Agile Tortoise showing what's new in version 5: Drafts 5: What's NewUpgraded and Awesome ThingsThat's a brief overview of the new things, now onto everything else!WidgetsDrafts 4 had a widget, which allowed quick entry by default and if you enabled \"Show More\" (on the top right) allowed you to see the most recent Drafts. Drafts 5 has 3 widgets - one for quick entry, one for your recent items, and one for your workspaces. This allows you to enable and disable the ones you want on different devices, and with the workspaces go straight to the collection of Drafts you need.Backup and ExportYour data is important, and there are backup options in Drafts which allow you to backup your drafts themselves, and/or your actions. These options were there before, but are now unified onto one screen. You can also export your drafts with the option to add a filter - so you could export all of your Drafts with the tag \"cake recipe\" if you wanted - for example to send them to me.Reminders ImportReminders import was present in version 4 too, but now you can add a tag when the reminders are imported - which is very helpful for filtering for them later.After Action SuccessThis setting used to be global which could be overridden on a per action basis. You can now set this option for each action group, and you can still override it for an action if you wish. This is extremely helpful for the keyboard action groups as you're unlikely to want most of those actions to archive or trash your Draft when use them.Drafts ForumsAgile Tortoise have set up forums where Drafts users can talk to one another, help each other create actions, request features, and more - I've already signed up and am checking it regularly to see what I can learn from everywhere else.Drafts ForumsConclusionI've been using Drafts 5 instead of Drafts 4 for quite some time now, and I'm very happy with it. It has been my go to \"text starts here\" application ever since I bought it after hearing it mentioned on an episode of the Mac Power Users at some point - and it has become more than that over time. With the scripts and actions I can now write entire blog posts in Drafts, and could even upload them to the server and post them immediately if I wanted. This app has more than earnt it's position in my dock and will be there for the foreseeable future.Other ReviewsTim Nahumck has written a much longer and more in depth review over on MacStories: Drafts 5: The MacStories ReviewColin Walker has a nice overview from the perspective of someone who has been using Drafts for many versions: Welcome Drafts 5Christopher Lawley has a video: Drafts 5: A Powerful Text Editor and Automation Tool for the iPad &amp; iPhoneJosh Ginter on the Sweet Setup tells you about all the new features: Drafts 5 launches with tagging, workspaces, advanced scripting functionality, and much moreMacSparky tells you about how he uses it: Big Update for DraftsAndre at Digitally Speaking Lab gives us a brief overview: Drafts 5 for iOSMac Rumors: Drafts 5 Overhauls Note-Taking App With New Themes, Editor Options and Action FeaturesGet The AppDrafts 5 is available in the App Store from today.","url":"/blog/my-drafts-5-review/","excerpt":"<p>[TOC]</p>\n"},{"id":"blog-taskpaper-to-omnifocus-project-in-a-folder-with-editorial","title":"TaskPaper to OmniFocus Project in a Folder with Editorial","categories":null,"tags":[],"content":"When OmniGroup first added Taskpaper support to OmniFocus they published an Editorial workflow which allows you to create new project - in the Mac Power Users Facebook Group someone asked if you could specify which folder the project should go into, a few minimal tweaks later and here is the solution!

The app isn't finished yet, but here are some of the features which you might enjoy. To make things clear, I have the dark theme on OF3, and the light theme in OF2 - and I've tried to do screenshots to let you compare the two easily.Multi Pane ViewsYou can now have a multipane view, this means you can have the traditional Home Screen on the left, tasks in the middle, and the inspector (detailed view of a task, project or tag) on the right - or you can have any combination of these three.Forecast ViewThere have been some changes to the Forecast view as well - primarily the interleaving of tasks and calendar events. This is purely based on the due time of a task and the time of the calendar event.A new feature is the ability to have a tag displayed in the forecast view. This might be very handy if you have lots of #waiting on tasks which you need to be on top of, or if there's a particular area you need to focus on. Of course, if you want multiple tags that's what perspectives are for.The InspectorThe inspector for tasks, tags, and projects has received some updates. You can set what you want to see and hide by default - so if you never use locations in tags (or contexts as they are in OF2) you can hide them.The Project Inspector The Tag Inspector The Task Inspector And of course these changes are present on the iPad as well.SearchSearch can now happen from any view, just by pulling down on the tasks list. Previously it was in the bar at the top.Location Based NotificationsThe notifications have had some changes made to them as well. Here on the top you see OmniFocus 3, and below it you see OmniFocus 2. Omnifocus 2 shows you the name of the context, the first task, and the number of other tasks available. OmniFocus 3 shows you the name of the tag, and how many tasks are available to you.The watch notifications are exactly the same. At first glance this seems like it is less information - but force touching or 3D touching the notification (depending on which device you're on) gives us a lot more choice. OmniFocus 3 here lets me View Location, or View Actions. OmniFocus 2 lets me dismiss the notification. NotificationsNotifications have had an overhaul - gone are the days where you get pinged as something goes from \"hell being about to break loose\" to \"apocalypse\", you can now set up a series of notifications for a task. If your task has a due date you can set reminders to happen X amount of time before it becomes due by adding minutes, hours, or days. Whether or not your task has a due date you can set a custom or fixed notification which will happen at the date and time you specify - very helpful. These notifications are one off, but the customisability is definitely something I'll be using frequently. FlaggingA task or project is flagged or isn't flagged. A task can inherit a tag from the project or task it belongs to - and none of this has changed in OmniFocus 3. What has changed is how you tag things. You can simply swipe from left to right on a task or project, and tap to flag it.You can also see very easily when a task is flagged because its parent is flagged which is very nice.Quick EditingSo swiping from left to right lets you flag or unflag, swiping in the other direction allows you to delete the task, or if you tap more you can schedule it - for today or tomorrow.Batch Task EditingIt's now possible to edit multiple tasks at once as well - this is hard to explain in screenshots so I've created a very short video for you.https://youtu.be/CZhEAUf5jKMTo summarise, I absolutely love the beta of OmniFocus 3.

And the more I have to do the more forgetful I tend to be - which results in things like misplaced keys, purses, ID cards - and naturally at the most inconvenient of moments. I heard about Tile a long time ago, but the thought of not being able to replace the battery or recharge the device seemed wasteful.Not too long ago, KeySmart, a company who makes Swiss army style covers for keys, came out with the KeySmart Pro - which has built in Tile technology, and a micro USB port. So now once every 2 months or so I need to charge my keys, but when I misplace them I can open the app on my phone, and make them ring. I‚Äôbe had this since November, and actually ordered two as I have the keys to my parents house - which I don‚Äôt need the vast majority of the time, so am more likely to misplace. After a while of having the ability to find my keys (though summoning them Harry Potter style is not yet possible, sadly) I realised that being able to locate my work ID and keys, or my purse would also be handy. This week I picked up a set of the Tile Mate and Slim. The slim is about the thickness of 2 credit cards, and the same height as one, I put one in my passport holder, and another in my purse (having managed to pack my purse in my checked luggage and spending an hour looking for it last week really pushed me here!). The Tile Mates will go on my work keys once I get home, and then I have a spare - purpose to be determined.One of the deciding factors for me when getting my first Tile though, was a story of a woman in Australia who had lost her keys. She marked them as lost in the TIle app and a few months later got a push notification that they had been found - someone had walked past the lost property area where her keys were and the Tile app on their device registered that her keys were present. While this sounds creepy, you can‚Äôt see anyone else‚Äôs devices unless they choose to share them with you - so your phone scans for the locations, and reports them back to Tile, but you don‚Äôt ever see the data yourself. The brilliance of this is helping others - maybe today I have all of my possessions where I expect them to be, but if/when I misplace one of my things it‚Äôs comforting to know that other people are helping me look, and they don‚Äôt have to lift a finger to do so.The advantages of Tile are simple:They will recycle dead devices and give you a voucher towards your next Tile, called ReTile.There‚Äôs a large network of users, which means if you can‚Äôt find your propery then maybe someone else can.It works.The KeySmart Pro is rechargeable.Unfortunately there are some disadvantages to Tile:You can‚Äôt recharge most of their devices.The white does discolour, depending on where you keep your items and how much you handle them this may be quick or slow, but the white will probably turn grey sooner or later.There are no notifications for leaving something behind. That said, for me the advantages well outweigh the disadvantages - and I‚Äôm very happy with my new system. I use my Apple Watch to ping my iPhone, and my iPhone to ping whatever is missing.","url":"/blog/tile-finding-the-things-i-lose/","excerpt":"<p>I am a forgetful person, not necessarily disorganised, but forgetful.

Due to the width of the street and the fact that it can be used for delivery vehicles Apple had prepared further waiting areas towards the other side of the street. The few of us tailing past the end of the ropes were asked to move to the middle and remain in order. Once that area filled up they moved on to the next and further on. Of course this meant there were lots of people milling around between the queues - but Apple had thought of that. When each queue was allowed to progress to the next one every person was given a card. You had to show this to enter the next queue, and then hand it over when exiting the queue or just before entering the store. This was a very simple but efficient system and prevented queue jumping. Thankfully the security managing the queues were multi lingual and friendly enough to allow you to make a quick bathroom or coffee run - assuming the people standing next to you in the queue were happy to hold your spot that was, they did stop allowing that at 9am though (30 minutes before the store opened). While we were in the queue four employees came through to photograph everyone and get permission to use your photo in their marketing material. If you didn't want to be featured they did request permission to take a photo anyway so they could work on an exclusion basis rather than an inclusion basis. At around 8:30am staff brought out coffee for people in the queue which was very much appreciated.https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpgeg? \"There are just two lines allowed next to the Apple Store\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpgeg? \"There are three further lines of the queue in the middle of the street\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"The queue\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpgeg? \"It's a bit like a reverse zoo\")? \"Making new friends in line!\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"Queue pass\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"Exercise Rings\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"A purchase and set up\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"Sockets embedded between the seats and the windowsills\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"Plants on the wall\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"HomeKit Corner\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"Upstairs\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"The queue from the window\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"Downstairs\")https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpg? \"Seating near the screen\")Postcards and a pinInstead of giving out t-shirts we were given postcards and a commemorative pin.

I've been looking for a project to practice my python and thought playing with lights would be fun. After assembling said light (I recommend the solderless set by the way, unless you really like soldering) and playing with it, I wanted to control it along with the Philips Hue lights which are around my desk - via HomeKit.Pimoroni has a guide to set up Mote lights via HomeKit, so with some tweaking I got it running.Make sure you install the software first. Then I had to modify their code - I don't have Mote lights, but I have the Unicorn pHAT. So instead of importing mote I had to import unicornhat, and very importantly I had to change the dimension of the lights - if you try to set lights that don't exist on the unicorn pHAT then it won't work. Despite doing this I had some problems with floats being returned instead of integers, so I changed all the division to use // instead of / which resolved that issue nicely. Here's the code for the API:#!/usr/bin/env pythonfrom colorsys import hsv_to_rgb, rgb_to_hsvimport unicornhat as unicornfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, make_responseapp = Flask(__name__)unicorn.set_layhout(unicorn.PHAT)unicorn.brightness(0.5)width, height = unicorn.get_shape()colour = 'FFFFFF'status = 0def hex_to_rgb(value):  value = value.lstrip('#')  length = len(value)  return tuple(int(value[i:i + length // 3], 16) for i in range(0, length, length // 3))def unicorn_on(c):  r, g, b = hex_to_rgb(c)  for channel in range(width):    for pixel in range(height):      unicorn.set_pixel(channel, pixel, int(r), int(g), int(b))  unicorn.show()  return Truedef unicorn_off():  unicorn.clear()  unicorn.show()  return Truedef get_status():  global status  for channel in range(width):    for pixel in range(height):      if unicorn.get_pixel(channel, pixel) != (0, 0, 0):        status = 1  return status@app.route('/unicorn/api/v1.0/&lt;string:st&gt;', methods=['GET'])def set_status(st):  global status, colour  if st == 'on':    status = 1    unicorn_on(colour)  elif st == 'off':    status = 0    unicorn_off()  elif st == 'status':    status = get_status()  return jsonify({'status': status, 'colour': colour})@app.route('/unicorn/api/v1.0/set', methods=['GET'])def get_colour():  global colour  return jsonify({'status': status, 'colour': colour})@app.route('/unicorn/api/v1.0/set/&lt;string:c&gt;', methods=['GET'])def set_colour(c):  global status, colour  colour = c  if status != 0:    unicorn_on(colour)    status = 1  return jsonify({'status': status, 'colour': colour})@app.errorhandler(404)def not_found(error):  return make_response(jsonify({'error': 'Not found'}), 404)if __name__ == '__main__':  unicorn_off()  app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)(I can't claim any credit here, I just modified their example to work for the unicorn pHAT instead of Mote.)Next I had to add the light to my HomeBridge installation.

A year later I use my AirPods most of the time without thinking about it. They have become something I take with me almost everywhere without thinking about it. From my smallest handbag, to the side of the pool, to flights across the Atlantic Ocean they have gone on every trip I've made. They're not perfect - if they had noise cancelling built in then I would use them even more instead of getting my over ear headphones out to block loud conversations and screaming children. But if I'm commuting to work these are what I reach for - and they're wonderful.Since the release of iOS 11 you can customise the controls on the AirPods independently of one another. I set my right ear to play/pause, and the left ear to skip the track. I rarely use the play/pause option to be honest - removing an AirPod is usually what I do, and the auto resume when you put it back in your ear has been flawless for me. The case for my AirPods is showing a few marks and dents where it has slipped out of my hand onto the pavement a few times, however as Apple have said they will be selling a case with Qi charging built in I'm not too worried - the Qi charging will allow me to top up the case regularly without really thinking about it.

Being a regular user of Workflow I'm very familiar with the concept - but Airmail does things a little differently.To get started with the custom actions you first need to enable integration with the apps you want to work with - for me this is primarily OmniFocus and Workflow, but not exclusively, this is done in the Services section - and there's everything from Dropbox to Instapaper, and even GitHub. So, what is the purpose of an action? An Airmail action allows you to chain multiple steps together - these can be purely email steps (e.g. forward an email, add a label, archive it), or involving external applications. I'll go through some of mine for you. ReceiptsI prefer to handle receipts as PDFs on my Mac - or to be precise, I let Hazel handle my receipts on my Mac. This means I need to get my receipts to somewhere on my Mac Hazel is watching. I have a Workflow which I usually share a PDF directly to - and Airmail has an option to share the message as a PDF to Workflow, along with a whole host of other options.The only catch is that Airmail shares a link to the PDF - but it can override the choice you previously made in Workflow to only accept certain document types. As such I added an If - and if the input is a URL I get the contents of it, and then have Workflow file the receipt in my chosen folder in Dropbox. You can get my Web Receipts Workflow here. Once the receipt has been saved as a PDF and filed I have Airmail delete the Workflow and that's it! One less email in my inbox. TravelI use TripIt to organise my travel - and TripIt is very good at parsing booking emails for the right data. While they do have an option to scan your inbox, I get enough bookings forwarded to me from my family and friends that this isn't a great option - otherwise I'd be in two places at once and permanently on holiday! (Unless I did a lot of manual management in Tripit.) My preferred solution then is to forward emails to TripIt myself - I then apply my travel label and archive the message. With this custom action I just have to confirm the forwarding of the message and Airmail does the rest for me. Waiting OnWaiting on is used a lot in Getting Things Done, essentially it's a list of things you're waiting on other people for - simple enough. However most of my waiting on 'tasks' come via my email inbox. I send Workflow the title and the link to the email, have it parse that and then add the resulting task to OmniFocus. You can get my Airmail Waiting On Workflow here. Link to ClipboardAirmail actually has a built in action for this, but I use it in parts of other custom actions and it's very handy to know how to get a link to an email as part of a custom action. All I do is use the Workflow action to send the mail link to a Workflow called Copy to Clipboard which has exactly one action - it takes whatever the input is and copies it to my clipboard. (I have this purely for the times when something is being difficult and the copy button is either not available or not working because I'm running a beta iOS). Track DeliveriesLast for now is Track Delivieries, I use the Deliveries App by Junecloud, and Airmail can either share a message to it directly, or as part of a custom action. I start by sharing to Deliveries, then use my Waiting On workflow from above, add an extra label of packages, and then archive the message. This way I can track my package, as well as see in OmniFocus I'm waiting on something.","url":"/blog/airmail-custom-actions/","excerpt":"<p>I've been experimenting more with <a href=\"http://airmailapp.com\">Airmail</a> on iOS recently, specifically the <a href=\"http://docs.airmailapp.com/airmail-for-ios/custom-actions-airmail-for-iphone\">custom actions</a>.

I have friends in multiple countries, if I want to call them I am almost never going to use the phone app - it'll be via FaceTime, WhatsApp, Telegram or Skype. Currently I have to remember which method I use and use it specifically.watchOSMore flexible watch faces. I would like to have a few completely customisable faces, think of a modular face with 9 boxes, you can choose to merge any boxes next to each other - allowing you to make complications of various sizes.tvOSAdding local media storage and apps like Infuse to the TV app. I have all this content, but I need to visit multiple different apps to find all my content.  Speaking of which: the TV app needs to be available outside of the USA/North America.siriOSI get it, Siri isn't an operating system. But it would be good if Siri could work (mostly) the same way across all platforms. I can't create a note on my watch - but I can on my phone. Consistency, and a shared brain would be excellent. Not needing to set up who my family is on every device would be a good start.","url":"/blog/wwdc-2017-hopes-wishes-and-predictions/","excerpt":"<p>With just 5 days to go before Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference everyone's getting in on the prediction/wish list action!  </p>\n"},{"id":"blog-json-feed","title":"JSON Feed","categories":null,"tags":[],"content":"Everyone's been talking about JSON feed recently, or at least that's how it seems!

Unfortunately there isn't yet a JSON feed plugin for Grav, however there is a feed plugin - which I was already using to provide RSS. As such I decided to do a bit of playing with it, and a pull request or two later there will be a JSON feed!

They have optional Trello Gold which means I can pay them and make them more likely to stick around - ideal!Then there was the challenge: \"how do I move my data from Wunderlist to Trello?\". There are a few paid tools out there, but as much as I'm happy to pay for a good service - I do love free! As such I decided to do it myself.The first step was exporting all of my data from Wunderlist. Inside of the Wunderlist web app, inside of your account settings you can create a backup. Unfortunately this brought me to my first problem. I suspect that Wunderlist doesn't play nicely with Safari, but giving me a file called \"Unknown\" with no extension wasn't very nice either way. Thankfully a quick Google told me that this is in JSON format and so I renamed it, and put it in my Workflow folder in iCloud.That done it was time to get started! The first thing to do was to poke around at the data and see what it was like. Workflow's \"Get Dictionary from Input\" was immensely helpful here, and I quickly managed to isolate the lists and tasks. I ended up creating two Workflows here, one which turns each Wunderlist list into a board, with a list - both of which have the name of the Wunderlist list, and then one which fetches all the tasks and puts them onto said list on the correct board.Wunderlist to Trello Boards and Lists and Wunderlist To Trello Tasks are the two Workflows here - I separated them to allow you to modify them separately more easily. Simply run the first one, and then the second one and off you go!","url":"/blog/migrating-wunderlist-to-trello/","excerpt":"<p>As <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/19/microsoft-to-shut-down-wunderlist-in-favor-of-its-new-app-to-do/\">Wunderlist is sadly shutting down</a>, I decided that I would move before I was pushed - so after some evaluation of my uses (shared lists primarily, and nothing that would end up in <a href=\"http://www.rosemaryorchard.com/blog/tag:omnifocus\">OmniFocus</a>) I decided on <a href=\"https://trello.com/roseorchard/recommend\">Trello</a>.

Along with the standard devices there are backup battery packs, and of course, if there are any long journeys you want everything fully charged before you depart! One handy little thing I've been carrying in my travel bag for over a year now is the AUKEY 5-Port USB Charger. As the name implies it has 5 ports, and each of them should charger at 10A (the power of the old iPad chargers). While it's not perfect - it certainly won't charge my massive 12.9\" iPad Pro in a hurry, it's more than good enough for nearly everything else. I can charge my phone, both iPads, headphones and a battery pack simultaneously - and if I plug in the behemoth of the iPad Pro overnight it'll be 100% come morning too.The best part of this though, at least for me, is that it uses a standard figure of eight lead - the same ones used on Apple's Airport range, the Mac Mini and the Apple TV - plus a plethora of other gadgets. This means you can buy alternative cables easily. As it's 110V-240V it will work around the world, all you need to do is plug it in. I personally prefer having different cables to take with me vs a regular cable and an adaptor - it takes up less space. Additionally in some places I visit frequently, I have a spare cable there - just to reduce on packing a little. Of course, this isn't the only charging solution I carry. As mentioned above I have battery packs, and as well as that I have the 29W USB C charger from Apple with the Lightning to USB C cable, and a standard Apple iPhone charger. These come in handy when plugs are inconveniently placed, more gadgets need charging, or I need to use my iPad Pro whilst charging it (it usually maintains battery life on the Aukey charger, but it certainly won't increase). Both Apple chargers are also ideal for use on a plane which has a charging socket too.I hope that at some point soon Anker will come out with a charging block with a well powered USB C port on it which will allow me to ditch the 29W adapter when travelling at least.","url":"/blog/charging-tech-while-travelling/","excerpt":"<p>Whenever you're on the go you always seem to end up needing to charge more gadgets simultaneously than at home - or at least you do if you're me.

I'm a big fan of free - and when that's nor possible affordable. Naturally XE Currency was my first port of call but that was a little out of my price range. A little Googling found Fixer.io which is free, and while not giving the identical rates to xe.com or my card company, close enough to give me a very good approximation. The first step was creating a Workflow which would get me the current exchange rate, and save it to a file so I could use it offline. A simple GET command and some RegEx was all that was needed to extract the exchange rate, then it was a simple matter of saving the file for later retrieval - and I added an alert at the end.","url":"/blog/tracking-exchange-rates-when-travelling/","excerpt":"<p>I've recently been travelling a lot (which as my family is well aware, is a normal state!) and wanted to be able to easily keep track of the exchange rate, plus be able to calculate the prices including tax - as well as find out how much it would be in my normal currency.</p>\n"},{"id":"blog-philofaxy-podcast-appearance","title":"Podcast Appearance - The Hitchhiker's guide to the Plannerverse","categories":null,"tags":["Podcast"],"content":"This week I was a guest on the Philofaxy podcast, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Plannerverse - Episode 51.
