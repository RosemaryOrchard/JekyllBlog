Today I'm excited to announce my new book: _Take Control of Shortcuts_.  
Shortcuts is a handy app, but even with examples it can be hard to know where to begin. People have asked me if I could recommend a guide to Shortcuts to them, and this book is my answer.  
It explains everything, from the user interface basics and essential terminology, to building and debugging your own complex shortcuts.  
The book includes 15 example shortcuts with exact steps to build them and download links for each. There are also chapters on working with APIs, as well as complementary applications you can use to enhance your Shortcuts experience.
