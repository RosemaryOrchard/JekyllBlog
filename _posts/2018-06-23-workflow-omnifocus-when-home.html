As such as I have the following Workflow which allows me to defer items until I get home.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ask for Input</code>: The first thing I do is input one or several tasks which I would like to accomplish.</li>
<li><code>Split Text</code>: Turn this block of text into a series of items.</li>
<li><code>Repeat with Each</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Change Case</code>: Make the task sentence case.</li>
<li><code>Text</code>: Flag the tasks and my preferred tags - Home, Afternoon, and Evening.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Â <code>Combine Text</code>: Turn this list back into a block.</li>
<li><code>Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will want to tweak the tags added to the tasks, to suit your needs. You may also wish to remove the flag I add to these tasks. You can get the workflow here: <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/9808cc5297094a2e8608385c86e4a395">OmniFocus When Home</a></p>
