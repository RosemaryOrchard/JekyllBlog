<p><a href="https://trello.com/roseorchard/recommend">Trello</a> is a lovely service which offers Kanban boards for planning - and I often like to plan out projects there, especially ones that need to be done in multiple stages or have many areas of focus. OmniFocus is my task manager of choice though which means I need my tasks to end up in there to have any hope of accomplishing them. To this end I have created a few <a href="http://workflow.is">Workflow</a> workflows to get the data out of Trello and into OmniFocus, theyâ€™re not very sophisticated - but they function very well.</p>
