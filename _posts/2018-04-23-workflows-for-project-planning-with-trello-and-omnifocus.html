<p><a href="https://trello.com/roseorchard/recommend">Trello</a> is a lovely service which offers Kanban boards for planning - and I often like to plan out projects there, especially ones that need to be done in multiple stages or have many areas of focus. OmniFocus is my task manager of choice though which means I need my tasks to end up in there to have any hope of accomplishing them. To this end I have created a few <a href="http://workflow.is">Workflow</a> workflows to get the data out of Trello and into OmniFocus, theyâ€™re not very sophisticated - but they function very well.</p>
<h3>Single Trello List to OmniFocus</h3>
<p><a href="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/</a> workflows-for-project-planning-with-trello-and-omnifocus/workflow-trello-list-to-omnifocus.png00 "Trello List To OmniFocus"){.image-right} Maybe you just have one list in Trello and you want to get the tasks and put them in OmniFocus. This workflow does exactly that. </p>
<p>Steps: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png</a> "Get Trello Items") <em>Get Trello Items</em>:  This gets all of your Trello boards.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png</a> "Text") <em>Text</em>: We format the title and the description of the card to be the name of the text and the note (in TaskPaper format notes are indented on a new line after their task).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png</a> "Combine Text") <em>Combine Text</em>: We put all of the cards together.</li>

<h3>Multiple Trello Lists to OmniFocus</h3>
