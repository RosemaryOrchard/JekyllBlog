<p>I'm very excited to be joining the ScreenCasts ONLINE team! My first short is a deeper dive into iOS 13, <a href="https://screencastsonline.com/tutorials/core-ios/first-look-at-ios-13-ipados-preview?ref=cascades42">Don did an overview</a> earlier this month when iOS 13 was released - and now iPadOS is out it seemed like a great opportunity to dive further into some of those new features.</p>
<p>In this episode, I'll show you some of the new features in core applications, including operating system changes, to allow us to use our devices more effectively and efficiently with all that iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 has to offer.</p>
