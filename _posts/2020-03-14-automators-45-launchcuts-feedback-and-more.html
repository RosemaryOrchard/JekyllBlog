  In this week's episode of Automators, David and I dove into our pile of
  feedback. As well as looking at Launchcuts, we also looked a how you can file
  feedback when things are broken on iOS (as some actions break in Shortcuts
  from time to time!), and reviewed our Streamdeck setup and more.

  While recording the show I thought I'd found a way to generate URLs to
  specific views in Airtable through a formula, but it turns out I had links to
  a record - not what I wanted! So if you know of a way to generate a link to a
  view then let me know!
