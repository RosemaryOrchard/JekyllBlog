<p>In this week's episode of Automators, David and I dove into our pile of feedback. As well as looking at Launchcuts, we also looked a how you can file feedback when things are broken on iOS (as some actions break in Shortcuts from time to time!), and reviewed our Streamdeck setup and more.</p>
<p>While recording the show I thought I'd found a way to generate URLs to specific views in Airtable through a formula, but it turns out I had links to a record - not what I wanted! So if you know of a way to generate a link to a view then let me know!</p>
