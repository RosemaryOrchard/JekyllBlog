<p>
  In episode 29 of Automators we got to talk to Adam Tow - creator of awesome
  automations. I met Adam at the Automators WWDC meet up this year and he demoed
  some of his wonderful shortcuts for me. I've seen them before and even tried
  them out, but once I saw Adam demoing them David and I knew we had to get him
  on the show to share how this all works!
</p>

<p>Adam walked us through a few of his amazing automations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://msgfiler.com/">MsgFiler</a>: A way to file messages in Mail
    extremely quickly. I've been trying this since we recorded and I'm sold,
    I'll admit I love using the keyboard and tend not to reach for the mouse
    unless I have to but this is a great utility!
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://tow.com/2016/12/31/wireless-photography-canon-5d4/"
      >Photo Magic</a
    >: Adam has an amazing setup whereby photos taken on his DSLR end up
    automatically sent to him via iMessage, added to Photos, uploaded to Google
    Photos, oh, and the RAW photos are uploaded to Amazon too. Sounds crazy?
    There's a bunch of <em>very</em> good reasons for this!
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3262"
      >The Dark Dungeon Text Adventure</a
    >: Did you know you can play a text adventure game in Shortcuts? Or have it
    translated into (almost) any language? Adam made it easy!
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For more details you'll have to listen to the show.</p>
<p>
  As a note, in the show I said I thought you could get a public link to a
  Dropbox folder through Shortcuts. You can get links to files, but for some
  reason links to folders no longer works - this is a shame, but we can hope
  that Dropbox offer this as a parameterised Shortcut in iOS 13.
