  I was really excited when <a href="https://nahmuck.me/">Tim Nahumck</a> agreed
  to come onto Automators to talk about
  <a href="http://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>! In the last year the app has
  increased in power so much, as well as gaining a Mac app, and now seemed like
  the perfect time to cover it.<!--more-->

  Today I thought I'd share a few bonus tips that were mentioned in the episode
  but not completely covered, starting with the Apple Watch component.

  In Drafts on the iPhone paired to your Apple Watch you can control some bonus
  settings. First of all you can enable auto-capture - this means when you open
  Drafts on your Apple Watch (such as from a complication) it will start
  listening for dictation - so you just open the app and start talking. You can
  also enable showing the inbox count, which is the number of Drafts in your
  inbox. The final extra setting is giving everything from your Apple Watch a
  default tag - mine is called Apple Watch (iOS and macOS automatically
  capitalise it, but drafts only uses lowercase tags to help you avoid
  duplicates). As I mentioned on the show, automatically tagging everything from
  your watch can be a useful indicator that your Draft might not be 100% what
  you said, but rather what the dictation engine <em>thought</em> you said.

  Something I realised not too long ago was that you can associate action groups
  with workspaces. A workspace is a saved filter of tags and/or a search term,
  and an action group is a group of actions - the one above the keyboard row,
  and the one in the pop out menu (which can be pinned open on larger devices)
  on the right hand side. In the bottom of the settings for the Workspace you
  can specify which action groups should be assigned to the keyboard row and the
  action pop out - so when you switch workspaces the rest of the app can switch
  too.

  Drafts is a very powerful app - so much so that it's replaced many other apps
  for me, I hope you enjoy the episode!
