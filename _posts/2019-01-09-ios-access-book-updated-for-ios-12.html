<p>Shelly Brisbin has been hard at work and updated iOS Access for All. It's a book about accessibility on iOS - walking you through using all of the Apple features designed to assist people. Additionally there are reviews of hundreds of accessible iOS apps. </p>
<p>Even if you don't have a disability yourself it is worth reading this book - many of the features talked about helpful for the rest of us too! </p>
<p>You can check the book out over at <a href="http://iosaccessbook.com">iOSAccessBook.com</a>.</p>
