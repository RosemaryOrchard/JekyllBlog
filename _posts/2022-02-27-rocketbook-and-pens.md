On the [latest episode of Automators](https://www.relay.fm/automators/96) with [Mikah Sargent](https://mikah.co), we went down a little bit of a rabbit hole with my RocketBook. After the show, both Sparky and Mikah decided to give it a try! Since then I've been contacted by a few people asking about my RocketBook, so here are the full details.

I have a [RocketBook Core](https://amzn.to/3Hnq5lf), in A4 dot grid. A4 is big enough that I have plenty of space to draw out diagrams, and the dot grid lets me draw and write neatly, without lines getting in my way.

I use a combination of the [Pilot Frixion Fineliners](https://amzn.to/3poiHzX) and [Pilot Frixion Markers](https://amzn.to/357QcQh). These are a bit thicker than the Pilot Frixion rollerball that comes with the RocketBook pack, but I find this works better for my handwritingâ€”and the ink is much easier to erase.

Erasing is easy, you just use a microfibre cloth (one comes with the RocketBook), and some water. I keep a small spray bottle of tap water in my office for plants, and cleaning my RocketBook.

There's something incredibly satisfying about finishing something and then erasing your notes afterwards.
