<p>?classes=image-right&amp;cropResize=200) I am honoured to be a guest on the fabulous <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu">Mac Power Users podcast</a> this week. I've been listening to the show for years and help to moderate the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/macpowerusers/">Facebook Group</a> - which is one of the nicest places to hang out on the internet. </p>
<p>As mentioned briefly in the show I'll be at the Chicago meet up in just over 2 weeks, for details of that listen to the start of episode <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/416">416</a>. If you have any suggestions on places to go or food to eat in Chicago then send me the recommendation on Twitter or via the contact page here!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/418">Here is the episode</a> - thanks to David and Katie for the great interview, and to the wonderful editor for making me sound coherent!</p>
