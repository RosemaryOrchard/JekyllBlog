<p><img class="wp-image-3365 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2019/09/1500x1500.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />In episode 5 of Nested Folders Scotty and I dived into our weekly review routines. It was also good to review traps we've both previously fallen into with our reviews - I've been considering making a printed list of how I do my weekly review and if I do so I'm also going to make a list of "not to do" on it - as a reminder of those lessons that I've learned over the years!</p>
