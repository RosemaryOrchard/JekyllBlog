<p>In the third episode of Automators we are joined by Sal Soghoian, AppleScript God, to learn about AppleScript and how to use it!</p>
<p>While David and I usually take it in turns to write up everything about the show and provide complete documentation, Sal's actually done that for this week:</p>

<p>You can find the scripts, videos, and a complete breakdown of everything over at <a href="http://macosautomation.com/automators/">macOSautomation</a>, along with all of Sal's other things.</p>
<p>In this show Sal gave us 3 AppleScripts. The first takes a whole table, and converts it into a bar chart in Keynote, the second takes a row or column and makes a pie chart, and the final one takes selected rows and turns them into a chart.</p>

<p>The brilliance of this, is the first script is just 17 lines - that's it!</p>
