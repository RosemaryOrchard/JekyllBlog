  A while ago <a href="https://katiefloyd.com">Katie Floyd</a> put out a call on
  Twitter looking for a replacement app which can overlay contact information
  onto your wallpaper for iOS. I thought "I bet you can do this with Workflow",
  and I was right! Here's how it works.

<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png"
      alt="Text"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Text</code>: This contains your name.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png"
      alt="Text"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Text</code>: This contains your phone number, advice: Don't use the
    number of your iPhone, use that of a trusted family member or friend, or
    your home phone if you have one.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png"
      alt="Text"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Text</code>: HTML formatting of the above two items, your name is
    set to be smaller than the phone number as it's likely to be longer and not
    quite as important.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/RichText.png"
      alt="Make Rich Text from HTML"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Make Rich Text from HTML</code>: Now we make that HTML into rich
    Text - applying the formatting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/PDF.png"
      alt="Make PDF"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Make PDF</code>: Bear with me, PDFs are great!
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Image.png"
      alt="Convert Image"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Convert Image</code>: PDFs can be converted to images - voila! We
    now have a white image with black text.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Image.png"
      alt="Crop Image"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Crop Image</code>: Let's make this approximately the same aspect
    ratio as an iPhone X screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Image.png"
      alt="Resize Image"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Resize Image</code>: Shrink it down to be about the right size
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png"
      alt="Set Variable"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Set Variable</code>: Make it easy to access in a moment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Photos.png"
      alt="Select Photos"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Select Photos</code>: Choose your background.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Image.png"
      alt="Mask Image"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Mask Image</code>: Here's the magic. The mask image action is like a
    very smart overlay, here it will make sure the text of your name and contact
    number shows up on the wallpaper, and nothing else.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/QuickLook.png"
      alt="Quick Look"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Quick Look</code>: Check it for prettiness.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img
      src="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Sharing.png"
      alt="Share"
      class="workflow-icon"
    /><code>Share</code>: Save it where you want!
  </li>
</ul>
