Not too long later I was invited to the beta of <a href="https://scriptable.app">Scriptable</a>, and got stuck in. </p>
    <p>Scriptable is an iOS 12 app, and has integration with Siri Shortcuts to help you automate to the max. Simon has integrated a huge number of iOS APIs - so you can get your current location, communicate directly with the calendar, and more. The app also uses native UI elements too - so if you write a script that shows an alert the JavaScript you write calls the native alert box. </p>
    <p>So, what can you do with this app? The built in examples include getting the current Slack status, grabbing the latest XKCD comic, and viewing shared JSON in a readable format. There are many more sample scripts over on the <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/c/ios/scriptable?u=rosemaryorchard">Automators Forums</a> where I host a community run forum for the app (what better home than with Automators?).</p>

    <p>You can also trigger Scriptable scripts in any number of ways. When you tap the settings icon inside of a script you get the option to immediately add the script to Siri, you can copy the URL scheme to the app, and even add it directly to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id532016360?at=1010lumu">Launch Center Pro</a> which will then let you trigger notifications to run it at specific times or places. </p>
    <p>All of your scripts are donated to Siri too, which means they're available in the Shortcuts app as well.</p>
