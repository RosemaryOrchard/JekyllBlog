  >Some time ago on Twitter I stumbled across Simon, he was retweeted by the
  developer of <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a>, an app I
  love and use heavily - and the retweet was a video of a script being run on an
  iPhone and returning some pretty cool results - so I asked "what is this and
  how can I get a copy?". Not too long later I was invited to the beta of
  <a href="https://scriptable.app">Scriptable</a>, and got stuck in.
</p>
<p>
  Scriptable is an iOS 12 app, and has integration with Siri Shortcuts to help
  you automate to the max. Simon has integrated a huge number of iOS APIs - so
  you can get your current location, communicate directly with the calendar, and
  more. The app also uses native UI elements too - so if you write a script that
  shows an alert the JavaScript you write calls the native alert box.
</p>
<p>
  So, what can you do with this app? The built in examples include getting the
  current Slack status, grabbing the latest XKCD comic, and viewing shared JSON
  in a readable format. There are many more sample scripts over on the
  <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/c/ios/scriptable?u=rosemaryorchard"
    >Automators Forums</a
  >
  where I host a community run forum for the app (what better home than with
  Automators?).

</p>
<p>
  You can also trigger Scriptable scripts in any number of ways. When you tap
  the settings icon inside of a script you get the option to immediately add the
  script to Siri, you can copy the URL scheme to the app, and even add it
  directly to
  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id532016360?at=1010lumu"
    >Launch Center Pro</a
  >
  which will then let you trigger notifications to run it at specific times or
  places.
</p>
<p>
  All of your scripts are donated to Siri too, which means they're available in
  the Shortcuts app as well.
