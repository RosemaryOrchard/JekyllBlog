  Episode 4 of automators is all about Shortcuts and Siri Shortcuts. We
  discussed what's possible now, what we're excited about (and not so excited).

  I did mention my automation I now use when boarding a plane - this is
  available over on <a href="https://sharecuts.app">Sharecuts.app</a> which we
  didn't get into this episode, but it's a great place to share Shortcuts and
  let other people download them!  

  You can listen to episode 4 on
