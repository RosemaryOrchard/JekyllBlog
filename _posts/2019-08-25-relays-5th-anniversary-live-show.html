<p>This week I was fortunate enough to be able to go to San Francisco and take part in a very special live show to celebrate the 5th anniversary of Relay FM - a podcast network now old enough for kindergarten!</p>
<p>For this show Myke, Stephen and Jason Snell devised a very special game of Family Feud - I'd never played before so of course I ended up being team captain (I'm not sure that was an entirely wise decision, but nonetheless it happened).</p>

<p>The episode is out now - wizards worked magic to turn 14GB of audio (seriously) into an episode overnight. <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/257">Listen to episode 257 of Connected</a>.</p>
