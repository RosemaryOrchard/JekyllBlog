    <p>Step 1 was finding an API I could use. I'm a big fan of free - and when that's nor possible affordable.

    <p>The first step was creating a Workflow which would get me the current exchange rate, and save it to a file so I could use it offline. A simple GET command and some RegEx was all that was needed to extract the exchange rate, then it was a simple matter of saving the file for later retrieval - and I added an alert at the end.</p>";}}
