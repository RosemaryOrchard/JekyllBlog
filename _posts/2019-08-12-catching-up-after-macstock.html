<p>Last month I went to MacStock - it was my first MacStock and my first time speaking there too (why not combine firsts!) and I had an amazing time. For anyone who has been on the fence about going I would highly recommend it - so many friendly people and it turns out we all have at least one thing in common ðŸ˜‰.</p>
<p>I've put together a page of the resources from my talks: <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/macstock-2019/">MacStock 2019</a> - here's where you can grab the Shortcuts to download them, as well as links to the apps I talked about!</p>
