  For episode 6 of Automators, we were very fortunate to have been joined by the
  wonderful <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com">Matthew Cassinelli</a>.
  Matthew writes for The Sweet Setup and iMore, has also written for Tech
  Crunch, and is a Shortcuts genius - we went through two more complex Shortcuts
  in this episode to give you some ideas of your very own.
