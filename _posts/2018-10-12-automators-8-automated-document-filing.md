  Episode 8 of automators is all about filing documents automatically. We we
  said in the episode, one of the keys to success is good naming and structure -
  and I made a screencast which shows you how you can use Keyboard Maestro to
  rename files in a specific format that we need for our project slides at work
  - with incrementing numbers in the _middle_ of the document name.
