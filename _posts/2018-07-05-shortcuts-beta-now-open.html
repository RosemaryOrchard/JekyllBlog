<p>Earlier today a few little birdies told me about the Shortcuts beta being open to sign up for if you have a developer account. If I hadn't already had one I might have been tempted to sign up for it just for this!</p>

<p>It seems Apple is sending out the invitations pretty quickly as mine has already arrived. I'm really looking forward to testing this and getting stuck in - iOS 12 has made some big promises regarding automation, I bet it will live up to them!</p>
