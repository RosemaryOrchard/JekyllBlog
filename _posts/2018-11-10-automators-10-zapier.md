  Episode 10 of Automators is all about Zapier. David and I both recently dove
  into Zapier plans and thought it would be a great topic for an episode - after
  all, we use it to automate Automators!  

<!--more-->

  As such, this episode goes behind the scenes and gives you some great examples
  of how you can get started with Zapier, as well as the advantages of using an
  online service for automation and some comparison to IFTTT and Microsoft Flow.  

  I hope you enjoy the episode and look forward to hearing how you use Zapier
  and any questions you might have
  <a href="https://talk.automators.fm">in the forums</a>. You can get the full
  details of the blog post over on
