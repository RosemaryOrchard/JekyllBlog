  In this latest episode of Nested Folders I introduced Scotty to the idea of
  the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay">Non Zero Day</a>. I stumbled
  across this a few years ago on Reddit and thought that it was a great idea,
  _do something towards your goals every day_. It might not seem like
  rocket surgery but saying it out loud and then reviewing your efforts can make
  a big difference - especially for those larger goals!

  There's more to no(n) zero days than this, so I'd highly recommend you check
  out the episode:
