<p><a href="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/backing-up-your-workflows-shortcuts/workflow-backup-workflows.png"><img class="alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/09/workflow-backup-workflows.png" /></a>It's almost time for the iOS 12 release and while I think that Shortcuts is going to be a separate app in the App Store to update to from Workflow, backups are a good idea. Of course backing up your device is a good idea, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to do a separate backup of your Workflows or Shortcuts that you've created - and maybe it's time to clear out your collection and start afresh (speaking as someone with over 800 Shortcuts, it's definitely time!).</p>
<p>I've created both Workflows and Shortcuts to do this for you, the Shortcuts shortcut is designed to be run on each of your devices - while iCloud Sync <em>should</em> be working now, some of us with extremely large libraries have had the syncing get a little stuck.</p>
<p>Essentially all this does is grab all of your Workflows and create a zip of them in iCloud Drive, the date and time you run the automation is included in the file name, and the Shortcuts variation also includes your device name.</p>
<p>Backups are good, and even if everything goes perfectly on Monday, which I'm sure they will, you won't regret it!</p>
<p>Keep on automating.</p>
