  I recently joined the team at TWiT and will be releasing iOS Today weekly with
  the lovely Mikah Sargant! This week was our first show, so of course, we had
  to take a look at my top 10 apps: Shortcuts, OmniFocus, Drafts, Carrot
  Weather, Apollo, Cardhop, Widgetsmith, NetNewsWire, Yoink, Pushcut  

<!--more-->

  We also covered news: Guided audio walking workouts may be coming to Apple
  Watch. After claiming it was working with Apple on its car project, Hyundai
  has reversed course. A new iPad Pro with a mini-LED display may be coming in
  March. After more rumors of Apple's AirTags, accessory makers seem to be
  working on products for the Find My devices.

  And then some listener feedback: iPad purchasing advice, THE {} AND
  relationship app, and installing a VPN at the router level.  

  Finally, we rounded off the show with our App Caps:
