  In this episode of Autmators, David and I took a headlong plunge into
  automating our capture and review processes. As we mentioned on the show,
  automated capture is a double-edged sword - capturing too much can lead to
  overwhelm, but I also find automated capture to be a problem solver as then I
  don't have to do the actual capturing myself, something that could be
  dangerous!

  Since we recorded the show I've been experimenting even more with Pushcut and
  the automation server to create projects in OmniFocus. It's not ready to share
  yet, but I'm working on that!

  For me, the biggest automation and productivity win recently has come from
  looking at review. I'm building an automated review of both tasks due today,
  tasks tagged with my Forecast tag, and tasks completed today into different
  parts of my day. This is really keeping me on top of things and things are
  slipping through the cracks less and less now.

  I'm also very glad that David is experimenting with the Shortcuts home screen
  again. I'm still not completely sold on this for myself, but there are several
  use cases where I can see myself benefitting. For the time being I'm working
  on using LaunchCuts to set up a good folder structure - and I've added a few
  Shortcuts to my home screen which just open specific folders. This means I
  only have to maintain the folders in one place, and with the smart folders
  this is pretty easy to do.
