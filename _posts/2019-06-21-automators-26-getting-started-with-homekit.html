<p>In the latest episode of Automators, David and I dived into our home automation setups and went beyond "I can control it from my phone" to find out what things you can really <em>automate</em>, because that's the kind of automation nerds we are!</p>
<p>I have personally been using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id995994352?at=1010lumu">Home 3</a> a lot to amp up my automations - this is what lets me specify the night time routine should only run if the kitchen light is on, and more. These things aren't available in the Home app that comes baked into your iPhone, but this app makes them available and doesn't require you to run anything else on a server somewhere to make it all work.</p>
