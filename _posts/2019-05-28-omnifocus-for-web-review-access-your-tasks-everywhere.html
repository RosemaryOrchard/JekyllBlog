<p>OmniFocus for the Web has released today! I ran through all the key features over on <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/omnifocus-for-web-review-access-your-tasks-everywhere/">MacStories</a>. I love that today is launch day but already in the beta version OmniGroup have new features (namely the Forecast view!) - and WWDC is right around the corner next week so they're clearly working hard.</p>
