As it's the start of the year I've been trying to figure out what my health goals are - but I couldn't let them get away from me without a little automation!</p>
<p>After we recorded I stumbled across <a href="https://chartyios.app/">Charty</a>, an app in beta which like many new apps popping up on my radar at the moment, is designed to integrate with Shortcuts. This one is, as you may guess from the name, designed to help you create charts with data. I've not yet figured out how to give it health data to make a chart (I suspect I need to split the times and data points first), but I'll be experimenting with this over the next few weeks!</p>
<p>One of my favourite things to do with Shortcuts, is to make "dumb" devices smart. I've helped my parents track blood pressure and blood glucose, as well as added Health integration to my FitBit scales, all with just a few Shortcuts.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the 41st episode of Automators: <a href="https://relay.fm/automators/41">Automated Health Tracking</a>!</p>
