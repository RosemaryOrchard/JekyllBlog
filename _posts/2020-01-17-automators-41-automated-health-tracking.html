<p>
  In this week's episode of Automators, David and I dove into health tracking.
  As it's the start of the year I've been trying to figure out what my health
  goals are - but I couldn't let them get away from me without a little
  automation!

  After we recorded I stumbled across
  <a href="https://chartyios.app/">Charty</a>, an app in beta which like many
  new apps popping up on my radar at the moment, is designed to integrate with
  Shortcuts. This one is, as you may guess from the name, designed to help you
  create charts with data. I've not yet figured out how to give it health data
  to make a chart (I suspect I need to split the times and data points first),
  but I'll be experimenting with this over the next few weeks!
</p>
<p>
  One of my favourite things to do with Shortcuts, is to make "dumb" devices
  smart. I've helped my parents track blood pressure and blood glucose, as well
  as added Health integration to my FitBit scales, all with just a few
  Shortcuts.
