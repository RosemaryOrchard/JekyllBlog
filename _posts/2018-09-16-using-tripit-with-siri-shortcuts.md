I was most pleasantly surprised today to see an update to the TripIt app which added support for Siri Shortcuts. They've kept it quite simple, with just two options: upcoming flight information, and upcoming travel plans.

The upcoming travel plans works in much the same way providing useful details. There is a nice touch if you don't have any upcoming travel plans though:

I'm very pleased to see apps that aren't for nerds updating with this sort of thing - that's what is needed to help Shortcuts become truly useful for _everyone_.
