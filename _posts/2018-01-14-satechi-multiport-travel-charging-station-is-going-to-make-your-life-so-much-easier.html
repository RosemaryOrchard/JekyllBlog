<p>I've got an Anker 5 port hub which has a USB C port with power delivery on it. It's great for a MacBook adorable or fast charging an iPhone or iPad, but it wouldn't do a great job on a MacBook Pro. I'm glad to see more of these devices coming to the market as they are absolutely perfect for travel!</p>
