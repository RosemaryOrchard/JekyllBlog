I've created both Workflows and Shortcuts to do this for you, the Shortcuts shortcut is designed to be run on each of your devices - while iCloud Sync _should_ be working now, some of us with extremely large libraries have had the syncing get a little stuck.  
Essentially all this does is grab all of your Workflows and create a zip of them in iCloud Drive, the date and time you run the automation is included in the file name, and the Shortcuts variation also includes your device name.  
Backups are good, and even if everything goes perfectly on Monday, which I'm sure they will, you won't regret it!  
Keep on automating.
