<p>I have a Raspberry Pi 3 running <a href="https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge">HomeBridge</a>, <a href="https://home-assistant.io">HomeAssistant</a>, and a few other services. It has a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/">7" touchscreen display</a> attached which is lovely - but bright. I prefer to turn the screen on and off when I want to use it instead of relying on the energy saver preferences (as I inevitably use the device just before I want to sleep) - however typing the terminal commands to do it is rather old fashioned.</p><!--more-->
<p> "Dictionary of actions in Workflow")</p>
<p>The first action is a dictionary - so every ssh command I run has a name which I look at when running the Workflow. You can have anything here of course - providing it's a valid SSH command. My commands are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Screen On</strong><br />
<code>sudo bash -c "echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/backlight/rpi_backlight/bl_power"</code></p>
<p><strong>Screen Off</strong><br />
<code>sudo bash -c "echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/backlight/rpi_backlight/bl_power"</code></p>
<p><strong>Restart HomeBridge</strong><br />
<code>sudo systemctl restart homebridge</code></p>
<p><strong>Restart HomeAssistant</strong><br />
<code>sudo systemctl restart home-assistant@homeassistant</code></p>
<p>Then Workflow asks you to choose an action to execute, and executes it. Finally you see the result of the SSH command returned to you - which is useful if there is output.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/bfd213edebfd4f9597cad6150a586e08">download the Workflow here</a>. You'll need to know the IP address of your Raspberry Pi, the username (default <code>pi</code>), and password (default <code>raspberry</code>). If your username and password are the default ones I recommend you change them.</p>
