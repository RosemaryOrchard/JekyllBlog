  Today I’m launching a new podcast called Nested Folders with a friend of mine
  <a href="heyscottyj.com">Scotty Jackson</a>. Scotty and I met when we started
  testing early versions of OmniFocus 3 together, I believe our first real
  encounter was me helping him replicate a bug report so he could nail down the
  steps to email in. (Coincidentally this is also where I met
  <a href="https://nostodnayr.net/">Ryan Dotson</a> who I ended up writing
  <a href="https://omnifocusbook.com">Build Your OmniFocus Workflow</a> with -
  who would have guessed that people eager to do an early beta test of OmniFocus
  would also be good people to make productivity related content with?!)

  Nested Folders is a productivity themed podcast, Scotty and I will be diving
  into all sorts of topics from project planning, to weekly reviews, when not to
  be productive and more. The

  I hope you’ll download the first episodes, give us a listen and subscribe. All
  of the details are over on the
  <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com">Nested Folders</a> website, and the
  podcast also has it’s own Twitter account
  <a href="https://twitter.com/NestedFolders">@NestedFolders</a> which because I
  am an automation geek automatically feeds into our spreadsheet for feedback.
