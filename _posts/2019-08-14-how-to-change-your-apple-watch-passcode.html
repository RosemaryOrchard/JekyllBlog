<p>The passcode on your Apple Watch is important, as it lets you use Apple Pay and keeps your device secure! Most people set their Apple Watch passcode once when they set up their device, and if you&#8217;ve migrated from an earlier generation Apple Watch, you probably brought your passcode along too. It&#8217;s always a good practice to periodically update any passwords you use frequently, and that definitely applies to your Apple Watch!</p>
