excerpt: The passcode on your Apple Watch is important, as it lets you use Apple Pay
  and keeps your device secure! Most people set their Apple Watch passcode once when
  they set up their device, and if you’ve migrated from an earlier generation Apple
  Watch, you probably brought your passcode along too. It’s always a good practice
  to periodically update any passwords you use frequently, and that definitely applies
  to your Apple Watch!
