<blockquote><p>Been thinking about all the trips, events, and other random things about which I’ve collected photos, video, and more over the last few years. So many things I keep meaning to write up, some of them now out of date.</p>
<p>This seems like exactly the kind of thing that could benefit from being called a “project”, and thankfully the new year is the perfect one for it.</p>
<p>So the theme for my website will be “Hindsight” for 2020. 🙃😆</p></blockquote>
