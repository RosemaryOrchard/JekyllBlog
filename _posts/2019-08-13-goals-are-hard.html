<p>So some time ago I set myself a goal and I've been plugging away at it, getting closer and closer to the point where it looks like I've done something. Unfortunately today I realised I've been ignoring the voice in the back of my head which says "you need to cover this part too!", well today I just had an honest look at it and it turns out... that voice was right.
