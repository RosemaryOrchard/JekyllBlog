<p>Today is <a href="https://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/">Global Accessibility Awareness Day</a> and I'm really pleased to see that Apple has updated the Shortcuts gallery to highlight some Shortcuts targeted at solving some of the problems people face every day. These shortcuts include:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Speak Brush Teeth Routine</li>
<li>Mood Journal</li>
<li>Special Day Countdown</li>
<li>Do Not Disturb timer</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 13 of these shortcuts in total, and it just goes to show how technology can be helpful for everyone, but in some cases it can make a massive difference.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2702 size-large" src="{{ "/assets/2019/05/shortcuts-for-accessibility-515x1024.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="Shortcuts for Accessibility Gallery screenshot" width="515" height="1024" /></p>

<p>These shortcuts are available in the Shortcuts app, in the gallery, it should be the first item featured at the top.</p>
