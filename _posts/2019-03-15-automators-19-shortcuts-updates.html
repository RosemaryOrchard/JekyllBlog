  In episode 19 of Automators David and I dive into recent updates to Shortcuts.

  David has recently updated his

  In the episode I talked about my backup and restore setup for Shortcuts - the
  thing that saved me when I "lost" hundreds of Shortcuts! First of all, you can
  find out how many shortcuts you have with this Shortcut:

    >Count &amp; List Shortcuts</a
  >. It explicitly ignores any untitled shortcuts - as those are ones which I
  created once to use and haven't got around to deleting. The next step is to<a

    >Backup Shortcuts</a
  >
  - I chose to do this as an archive, because it simplifies the process in the
  next shortcut -

    >Install Missing Shortcut</a
  >. Even if you aren't having problems with your Shortcuts it never hurts to
  back them up, this way if you like me get stuck in a corner due to betas then
  you can uninstall and reinstall with no qualms.

  When we were talking about the 2.2 update and what it will bring to Notes, I
  mentioned you could use a shortcut to handle the possibility of multiple notes
  - in fact you can use one Shortcut to handle this possibility with anything.

    >Handle Multiple</a
  >
  is a mini shortcut which lets you handle possible multiple inputs - if it just
  has one, be that a note, file, contact, or indeed anything, it returns it,
  otherwise it lets you choose and returns the chosen item. It's quite clever
  that you can provide input to a shortcut without it needing to be able to
  accept it - this keeps it out of your share sheet. To set this up though I did
  enable that to use the magic variables for Shortcut Input, and then I turned
  it off again.
