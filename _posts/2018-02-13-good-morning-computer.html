    Users Facebook Group I was challenged to make a Workflow which would tell the
    user about their upcoming day. When it runs Workflow will say something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Good
    morning Rose, it is 07:38. \nIn Vienna the weather will be mixed precipitation
    throughout the week, with temperatures rising to 6°C on Friday..\nThe current
    temperature is 0 degrees celcius.\nThere is a 11% chance of rain.\nYour iPad has
    80% battery.\nYour calendar events for today are Shrove Tuesday, Work.\nThe top
    news headlines for today are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here
    is some of your favourite music:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After it speaks this it
    then plays some of my favourite music (shuffling from a playlist I chose). </p>\n<p>So,
    how does this all work? </p>\n<p>When you import the Workflow it asks you three
    questions, what you name is, your Dark Sky Weather API, and the RSS feed of your
    favourite news source.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/good-morning-computer/workflow_import_questions.png\">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/good-morning-computer/workflow_import_questions.png</a>)</p>\n<p>You
    can get your <a href=\"https://darksky.net/dev/docs\">API Key from Dark Sky</a>,
    on the free plan you get up to 1000 calls per day - more than enough for our Workflow.</p>\n<p>Next
    the Workflow gets the data we need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the date</li>\n<li>the titles
    of the last 6 items from the RSS feed</li>\n<li>the current location and the name
    of it</li>\n<li>the weather for your current location</li>\n<li>the kind of device
    you're using</li>\n<li>the battery level of the device you're using</li>\n<li>your
    calendar events for today</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then this information is inserted into
    the text, let's look at that again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Good morning <strong>Name</strong>,
    it is <strong>Current Time</strong>. \nIn <strong>City</strong> the weather will
    be <strong>Weather Summary</strong>.\nThe current temperature is <strong>Temperature
    degrees celcius</strong>.\nThere is a <strong>Rain %</strong>% chance of rain.\nYour
    <strong>Device Model</strong> has <strong>Battery Level</strong>% battery.\n<strong>Calendar
    Events.</strong>\nThe top news headlines for today are <strong>Headlines</strong>.\nHere
    is some of your favourite music:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everything in bold is
    a variable, replaced with data we either fetched from the internet, or collected
    from the device. After this text all that Workflow has to do is use the speak
    text action, and the play music action. </p>\n<p>There are two current versions
    of the Workflow, <a href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/94ba7b07407948bdbabccfdb4c1d63fa\">an
    imperial version for those who prefer Farenheit</a> and a <a href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/c9964e848eee49c6a3b4290f00338322\">metric
    version for those who prefer Celsius</a>. If you download either of these you
    can have your device talk to you in the morning, and tell you about your day.</p>\";}}"
