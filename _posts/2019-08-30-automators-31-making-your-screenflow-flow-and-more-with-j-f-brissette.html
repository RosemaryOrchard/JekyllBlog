  In this episode of Automators David and I got a chance to dive behind the
  scenes of ScreencastsOnline and into the Terminal app (not at the same time)
  with J.F. Brissette. David and J.F. met years ago at Macworld!
</p>

<p>
  J.F. does editing and assembly for ScreencastsOnline — which means he spends a
  lot of time working with video and audio in ScreenFlow, and he has got his
  workflows down with automation. As he said “it needs to be automated if you’re
  going to use it as much as I do” which is something worth bearing in mind for
  any application you use heavily.
</p>
<p>
  Keyboard Maestro is his tool of choice (as it is for many people), and he has
  many macros which he has found. The Clipboard History Switcher specifically
  makes it much easier to copy and paste elements around — also allowing you to
  create a palette of elements from your macros, something that applies to many
  kinds of work!
</p>
<p>
  J.F. also uses Terminal a lot, for everything from opening apps to checking
  what day you were born on or what day your birthday will be on next!
</p>
<pre><code>open -a Safari
open -a "Keyboard Maestro"
</code></pre>
<p>
  These open apps — because Keyboard Maestro has a space in its name it needs to
  be wrapped in quotation marks. Note that capitalisation is optional, and you
  can use either single or double quotation marks — J.F. tends to use lowercase
  and single quotations, like this: open -a 'keyboard maestro'.
</p>
<pre><code>cal 01 2021
</code></pre>
<p>
  This will show you a calendar for January 2021 – so you can quickly scan for
  “11” and see that my birthday will be on a Monday!
</p>
<p>
  We also had a look at regular expressions, which are a way to do search (and
  replace) with extra magic by defining very specific patterns. Shortcuts even
  supports regular expressions, both to "Replace Text" as well as with “Match
  Text”, which can be followed by “Get Group from Matched Text.”
