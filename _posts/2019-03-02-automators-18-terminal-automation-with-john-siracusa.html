<p>On episode 18 of Automators David and I interviewed John Siracusa, web developer, Perl fan, and former reviewer of Mac OS X (as it was then) for Ars Technica. John was a wonderful guest on the show - we talked about what automation he does, and doesn't do - as well as the how and the why! Like many of our listeners John is very much a Mac first user - I hope you enjoy the show!</p>
