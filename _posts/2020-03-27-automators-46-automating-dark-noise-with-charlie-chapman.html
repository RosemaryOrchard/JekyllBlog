  In this episode of Automators, David and I interviewed Charlie Chapman, host
  of <a href="https://launchedfm.com/">Launched</a>, and creator of
  <a href="https://darknoise.app/">Dark Noise</a>, about adding automation to
  your life with a little white noise, and the process and benefits of adding
  support for Shortcuts to apps.
