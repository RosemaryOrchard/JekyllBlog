  In episode 37 of Automators David and I got our enchanted brooms ready and
  went to town on maintaining and managing your Mac. We did our best to get out
  all the cobwebs and find a way to automate all of this, while there may not be
  a robot vacuum for your Mac, there are plenty of tools you can use to make the
  magic happen automatically - good whether it’s your system or one you end up
  managing because the owner relies on you to do it!

  First up we tackled trash. I realised after the show that while we talked
  about how to use Hazel’s built in preference pane to manage the trash, I
  didn’t go into detail about how I do the more specific things that don’t show
  up there. The answer is (relatively) simple, I add the trash as a folder -
  this is easiest to do if you have something in the trash as you can drag that
  into the selector in Hazel. This lets me add all the usual Hazel rules, though
  I should also mention I’m doing it this way because that’s how I’ve done it
  for quite a while, rather than this being a good practice!

  We also talked about Dropzone, there are a lot of actions available that you
  can just install in Dropzone, there’s an
  <a href="https://aptonic.com/actions/">official actions page</a> and a further
  <a href="https://atika.github.io/dropzone3-actions/">action repository</a>, I
  really need to look into deleting/moving files after I’ve done specific
  actions, but these are a great way to automate nonetheless.

  I hope you enjoy this episode of Automators, it was great fun to put together!
