<p>My friend David Sparks has been at it again - there's a brand new video course all about Siri Shortcuts. </p>

<p>The course includes 40 videos which total over 3 hours of material to watch, and loads of Shortcuts you can download directly. The guide is available for $24 right now, but will be going up to $29 shortly after launch.</p>
<p>What I love about this course is it doesn't matter if you don't know anything about Siri Shortcuts or Workflow, or if you're a grand master - you can still learn something. </p>
<p>You can sign up for the course over at David's new learning website, and while you're there you should pick up his <a href="https://learn.macsparky.com/p/workflow">free Workflow guide</a> too - <a href="https://learn.macsparky.com/p/siri">learn.macsparky.com</a>.</p>
