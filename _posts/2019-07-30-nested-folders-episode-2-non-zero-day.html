<p>In this latest episode of Nested Folders I introduced Scotty to the idea of the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay">Non Zero Day</a>. I stumbled across this a few years ago on Reddit and thought that it was a great idea, <em>do something towards your goals every day</em>. It might not seem like rocket surgery but saying it out loud and then reviewing your efforts can make a big difference - especially for those larger goals!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's more to no(n) zero days than this, so I'd highly recommend you check out the episode: <a href="https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/episode-2-non-zero-day/">Episode 2 of Nested Folders</a>.</p>
