And sometimes you use built in screen recording to capture what's happening on a device. You probably use these features even more frequently if you’re beta testing an app - and that’s how this Workflow came to be. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nostodnayr">Ryan</a> mentioned in the OmniFocus Beta Slack that his camera roll was suffering with all the screenshots he’s been taking. Challenge accepted. This workflow will help you delete <em>both</em>  screenshots and screencasts you’ve taken on your devices.</p>
<p>Steps: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Calculator.png">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Calculator.png</a> "Number") <code>Number</code>: Set this number to be the number of screenshots and screencasts you want to go through.</li>

<li><a href="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png</a> "Choose from List") <code>Choose from List</code>: You select which screenshots you want to delete. </li>

We’re using this action rather than "Delete Files" because the Videos actions outputs a "photo like object".</li>
