<p>I was most pleasantly surprised today to see an update to the TripIt app which added support for Siri Shortcuts. They've kept it quite simple, with just two options: upcoming flight information, and upcoming travel plans. </p><!--more-->

<p>The upcoming flight information is especially helpful telling you how long you have before your flight, and the flight number as well as the airline. </p>

<p>The upcoming travel plans works in much the same way providing useful details. There is a nice touch if you don't have any upcoming travel plans though:</p>

<p>I'm very pleased to see apps that aren't for nerds updating with this sort of thing - that's what is needed to help Shortcuts become truly useful for <em>everyone</em>.</p>
