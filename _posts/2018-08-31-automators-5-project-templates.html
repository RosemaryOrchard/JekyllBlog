David and I are both OmniFocus users, but project templates can be used with almost every task management system out there - even Reminders! </p>
    <p>The simplest type of project template is a project you can copy - this is easily done in both OmniFocus and Things, the advantage is it's easy to set up, but it's also static - what you have is what you get.</p>
    <p>You can also store project templates somewhere else, the places I have used are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Editorial</li>
    <li>iCloud Drive </li>
    <li>Dropbox</li>
    <li>Drafts</li>
    <li>Workflow/Shortcuts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One thing I have done is to import all of the templates I'd previously saved into Dropbox and iCloud Drive into Drafts - this was easily done by pressing and holding the <code>+</code> icon which then lets you import a file.</p>
    <p>Something I use a lot when making templates for OmniFocus is TaskPaper - and I even made a <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1F6">Drafts Action Group</a> to help me do so easily. What you can do with OmniFocus and TaskPaper is create a template in OmniFocus, copy it and then paste it into a text editor (like Drafts) to edit it - this allows you to put "fuzzy dates" in, such as "Thursday" or "Monday -2d", the latter evaluating to two days before Monday. You can also include <code>«variables»</code> which the TaskPaper to OF action will then help you replace.</p>
    <p>I demonstrated how to use this action group in a screencast for you:
    <a href="https://youtu.be/xit6JLmbnZY">plugin:youtube</a>
    And there's also a blog post all about it: <a href="https://www.rosemaryorchard.com/blog/using-drafts-5-taskpaper-with-omnifocus">Using Drafts 5 Taskpaper with OmniFocus</a></p>
    <p>As I mentioned in the podcast, Todoist supports importing a CSV file - and if your task manager does too then you can use Numbers or Excel and date math to make relative dates. </p>
    <p>So, what kind of project templates might you create?</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Packing Lists</li>
    <li>Publishing a podcast episode</li>
    <li>Writing and submitting an essay/report</li>
    <li>And much more!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While David and I are both primarily OmniFocus users, there are also lots of great resources for Things users:</p>
    <ul>

    <li><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1DV">Things Parser</a></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>And the Todoist blog also has a post called <a href="https://blog.todoist.com/2015/11/19/new-way-to-create-todoist-templates/">A whole new way to create and share Todoist Templates - Todoist Blog</a>.</p>
    <p>One of the workflows/Shortcuts I mentioned on the podcast was one to create an essay project, the options here are somewhat simplified, but demonstrate quite nicely how this works:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/b26737b265064cfcbe1e7ff96bef7189">Essay to OmniFocus</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/22bd0892decf40a9a9b10aebf5a84701">Essay to OmniFocus</a>
    As the URL Scheme in Things doesn't support adding headings I formatted the project in Things somewhat differently - however you can import a JSON which does support headings format so if you're willing to get stuck in I'm sure you can figure it out!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another Workflow/Shortcut I mentioned is the iOS implementation of these scripts:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://curtclifton.net/poptemp">Populate Template Placeholders—curtclifton.net</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/1/14/tweaking-omnifocus-project-template-applescript.html">Tweaking OmniFocus: Project Template Applescript — MacSparky</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/lemonmade/templates">Chris Suave: Templates Applescript for OmniFocus.</a>
    What they allow you to do is to store a project in OmniFocus and then run AppleScript, which will parse out <code>«variables»</code> and create a new project, with the help of the share sheet and two Workflows I recreated this functionality and wrote about it on Colter Reed's blog: <a href="https://colterreed.com/how-to-fill-out-omnifocus-project-templates-with-workflow/">How to Fill Out OmniFocus Project Templates with Workflow | Colter Reed</a>. What is probably interesting for you is that this is not one Workflow but two, and the second one is recursive - that is it calls itself until a condition is met, for this workflow that there are not more variables to parse. Using Workflows/Shortcuts as a function is something I rarely see but is extremely useful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>David also did a great screencast about how he uses Shortcuts to make project templates:
    <a href="https://youtu.be/6FMS4c3S9p8">plugin:youtube</a></p>
    <p>Make sure to check out the <a href="https://relay.fm/automators/5">show notes</a> for all of the links, and I look forward to discussing this episode and all of your examples for project templates <a href="https://talk.automators.fm">in the forums</a>!</p>";}}
