    >Orange County</a
  >, David and I are hosting a meetup at WWDC - Tuesday lunchtime to be
  specific! We don't have the precise location nailed down yet (we'd like to
  meet outside) so make sure to keep an eye out for updates on this event! As
  well as David and myself, Alex Cox and Matthew Cassinelli of
