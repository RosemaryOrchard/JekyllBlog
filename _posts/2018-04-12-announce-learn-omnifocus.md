For those of you not familiar with Learn OmniFocus, it’s a great site with <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/articles/?ref=16">articles</a>, <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/videos/?ref=16">videos</a> and more which will help you learn about OmniFocus. You can see some examples from <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/recordings/omnifocus-workflow-guests/?ref=16">previous workflow guests</a> if you want to get an idea of what my session will be like. If you’re a member there’s plenty of extra goodies too like AppleScripts - including the ability to watch my session live and chat with everyone before and after but the chat sessions won’t be included.  
I hope to see some of you there!
