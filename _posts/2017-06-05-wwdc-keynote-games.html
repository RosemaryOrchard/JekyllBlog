<p>Today is the day, Apple fans are perhaps a little too excited but that's par for the course. We've had plenty of "pre-announcements" and speculation that these have come over the last week because they're running short of time in the Keynote. There's even been an apparent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6ezhwm/iama_foxconn_insider_with_information_on_next_12/">supply chain leak</a> on Reddit (and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6f21c7/everything_ufoxconninsider_reported_today/">handy summary</a> if you don't feel like wading through all those comments).</p>

<p>There are a few WWDC games you can play along with during the keynote (useful if it's 3am your time and you're tired!), so I made a short roundup:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/143">Upgrade #143</a>: Myke or Jason? Who gets more points? There's a PDF scorecard in the comments, and you can listen to their episode afterwards discussing the event and dishing out scores (they have an independent judge incase they can't agree!).</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6f7dkr/for_the_first_time_in_2017_back_again_its_apple/?st=J3IRCB7T&amp;sh=4a5baabf">WWDC 2017 Keynote Bingo</a>: From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMechanoids">/u/TheMechanoids</a> on Reddit. I appreciate the fact that "one more thing..." is right in the middle - and I hope we get a full house!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/144">Connected #144</a>: Federico, Stephen and Myke decided not to score but to decide who would be happier, Federico suggested the Happy-o-meter, and I <a href="https://twitter.com/rosemaryorchard/status/869961982740398080">threw one together</a>, there was a positive reaction on Twitter so <a href="Connected_Happy-o-meter.pdf">here it is in PDF</a> for you if you prefer that to an image.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun, and remember - even if you don't get what you thought you wanted you might well get something much better.</p>
<p>Personally I've even thrown a WWDC 2017 wallpaper on my watch ;) (Wallpaper available from <a href="http://www.macerkopf.de/2017/02/22/wwdc-2017-wallpaper-hintergrundbilder-als-download/">macerkopf.de</a>).</p>

<p>Oh, and if you're planning on installing the developer betas don't forget to do an encrypted backup first.</p>
