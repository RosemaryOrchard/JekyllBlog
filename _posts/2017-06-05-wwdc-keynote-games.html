    <p>There are a few WWDC games you can play along with during the keynote (useful if it's 3am your time and you're tired!), so I made a short roundup:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/143">Upgrade #143</a>: Myke or Jason? Who gets more points? There's a PDF scorecard in the comments, and you can listen to their episode afterwards discussing the event and dishing out scores (they have an independent judge incase they can't agree!).</p>

I appreciate the fact that "one more thing..." is right in the middle - and I hope we get a full house!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/144">Connected #144</a>: Federico, Stephen and Myke decided not to score but to decide who would be happier, Federico suggested the Happy-o-meter, and I <a href="https://twitter.com/rosemaryorchard/status/869961982740398080">threw one together</a>, there was a positive reaction on Twitter so <a href="Connected_Happy-o-meter.pdf">here it is in PDF</a> for you if you prefer that to an image.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Have fun, and remember - even if you don't get what you thought you wanted you might well get something much better.</p>
    <p>Personally I've even thrown a WWDC 2017 wallpaper on my watch ;) (Wallpaper available from <a href="http://www.macerkopf.de/2017/02/22/wwdc-2017-wallpaper-hintergrundbilder-als-download/">macerkopf.de</a>).</p>
