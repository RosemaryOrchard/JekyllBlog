<p>I recently discovered a little trick from the Map app in iOS - that you can add a rich contact to your contact, complete with map.</p>
<p>1. The first step is finding the place on the map - Apple Maps has got much better over the years so points of interest and useful places like doctors surgeries are often searchable by name.</p>

<p>2. Then you need to choose to either add a new contact, or add this information to an existing contact.</p>
<p>?resize=200)</p>
<p>?resize=400)</p>
<p>3. Once this is done you have an enhanced contact - complete with mini map, and any other information that is attached to that place in Maps - so here we have opening hours and more.</p>
