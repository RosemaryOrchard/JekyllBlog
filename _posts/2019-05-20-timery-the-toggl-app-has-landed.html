  David Sparks and I teased it on Automators back in
  <a href="https://relay.fm/automators/17">episode 17</a>, and now the app is
  here: <a href="https://timeryapp.com">Timery</a>, the Toggl app we all wish
  Toggl had made! the

  What’s impressive about this app, is that I rarely launch it, but I’m pretty
  sure my workflow would feel broken without it. Timery has excellent
  integrations with Shortcuts, letting me start and stop timers as part of my
  automations without thinking. Whenever I run Shortcuts to put myself into
  certain modes (such as podcasting, or writing for my blog), as well as
  launching the correct applications, I also start logging my time. I also build
  in checks to let me know how long I’ve already worked on projects today when I
  end my timers - this is a not so gentle nudge that if I want to achieve my
  goals, I should invest an appropriate amount of time in them!<br />

  The main screen in Timers is your saved timers which serve three purposes,
  letting you start tracking a project, with tags and a description if you so
  choose, with just a tap. These timers are also donated to Siri (and therefore
  Shortcuts), and also display how long you’ve worked on those timers today. I
  find this screen great for both a quick overview as well as starting timers.

  The next screen is Time Entries where you can see log of your most recent time
  entries. There are swipe options for these entries allowing you to delete or
  edit them, as well as play button which lets you start a new time tracking
  entry with the same parameters.

  The developer behind Timery, <a href="joehribar.com">Joe Hribar</a>, has
  worked extremely hard to make sure this app rivals the Toggl app - it has all
  the core functionality covered, as well as genuinely excellent shortcuts
  support. This means there’s full support for Workspaces, the premium Toggl
  feature which lets you helps you carve up your life further with tags and
  projects belonging to Workspaces.<br />

  The way I use Timery most, is through Shortcuts. I use Launch Center Pro and
  Pushcuts to send me notifications which I use to launch Shortcuts, and these
  shortcuts tell Timery to track my time for me. As all the saved timers can be
  used to both start timers as well as check the time logged so far on each of
  them this alone becomes helpful for tracking time. The Shortcuts support
  allows you to toggle “show when run” (this is the only setting on all donated
  shortcuts within the Shortcuts app right now) - this is used to show you the
  details of your time tracking, and it’s done in a minimalist way which makes
  sure I see the information I need and can dismiss the notification within a
  second or two at most.
</p>
<p>
  As well as the saved timers in the app, you can also just start time tracking
  and add the details you want or need - which makes it easy to get going and
  then you can give it a title, project, or tags later before you finish (or
  after the fact with the Timery club).

  The Timery app in its free state is excellent, but if you join the Timery
  Club, an optional in app subscription of $9.99/year, as well as supporting
  development of the app you get extra functionality:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Unlimited saved timers, the free version allows you to have 4 saved timers
    (which in my opinion is a generous number).
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit all the elements of time entries from the last week as well as delete
    and duplicate them.
  </li>
  <li>Add historical time entries.</li>
  <li>Add, edit, and delete Toggl projects, tasks, and tags.</li>
  <li>
    Show your tag names in the saved timers (otherwise the tag icon is
    displayed)
  </li>
  <li>
    Custom themes, app icons, and dark mode. Dark mode can be toggled based on
    the screen brightness, sunrise, and sunset, or manually.
  </li>
</ul>

  If you have no interest in tracking your time then this app is not for you,
  but if you’re curious about it, or have been struggling with it - or even if
  you already track every second and want to make your life easier, I highly
  recommend downloading Timery. It has made it much easier for me to track my
  time, because it is very simple to use - and in my case, it builds right into
  my shortcuts that I already use to launch a significant number of actions.
</p>
<p>
  Timery feels like a much better-designed app than the Toggl app, there’s more
  data on the screen, and I can choose what data goes on what screen - as well
  as the Shortcuts that should be donated (instead of doing the action and
  letting it show up and then having lots of unnecessary actions in my Shortcuts
  app. Plus the developer is active and open to feedback and suggestions for
  improvement!
</p>
<p>
  Timery is available on the App Store today, it’s a free download with an
  optional in app purchase for the Timery Club which is $0.99/month or
  $9.99/year.
