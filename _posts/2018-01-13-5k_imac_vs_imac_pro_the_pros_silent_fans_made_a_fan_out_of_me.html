<p>Stephen Hackett did exactly what I would have done - calculated that the top of the range iMac would do it, bought it, and regretted it. I'm not in the market for an iMac right now but his experience here is one I'll keep in mind. For now my 2011 Mac Mini Server is still running well enough - hopefully that will remain the case until Apple finally release a new model.</p>
