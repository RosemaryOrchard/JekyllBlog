    or a menu. What about a dictionary? If you're not a programmer and have had little
    experience with writing for computers in general then this can be a little overwhelming.
    </p>\n<h3>Lists</h3>\n<p>A list is exactly what it sounds like. You have a list
    of items, and you can choose from them or get a specific item (at an index, so
    the 1st or 5th item for example). A list gives you what you choose - so if you
    have a list of animals, when you choose \"Cat\" you get \"Cat\" - fairly simple.
    </p>\n<p>You can make lists in a few ways, if you <code>Add to Variable</code>
    you can get that variable and use <code>Choose from List</code>. You can also
    <code>Split Text</code> and then <code>Choose from List</code> again. There is
    also the list action you can add items to - and you follow it with a <code>Choose
    from List</code> action again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-menus-lists-dictionaries/workflow-list.jpeg?cropResize=300,300\">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-menus-lists-dictionaries/workflow-list.jpeg?cropResize=300,300</a>

    able to do different things based on the option chosen (e.g. reminder vs calendar

    you can work around this by using the <code>Text</code> action if you need it.</p>\n<p><a

    is somewhere between a list and a menu in many ways. If I choose \"Spaghetti Bolognese\"
    then a dictionary can return \"ground beef, tomatoes, onion, spaghetti...\". This
    can have all sorts of applications - and Workflow actually gives you dictionaries
    a lot of the time when you put the <code>Choose from List</code> action after
    another, such as <code>Search App Store</code>. \nDictionaries can really help
    improve your Workflow experience. Maybe you want to have a simple list of people,
    and when you select one you get that person's phone number - or maybe you want
    to get complicated and go crazy. That's all possible with dictionaries. \nA dictionary
    is a series of keys and values. The key is what you choose, and the value is what
    you get. There are multiple ways to make dictionaries in Workflow - the simplest
    way though is to use the Dictionary action.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-menus-lists-dictionaries/workflow-dictionary-choose-from-list.jpeg?cropResize=300,300\">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-menus-lists-dictionaries/workflow-dictionary-choose-from-list.jpeg?cropResize=300,300</a>
