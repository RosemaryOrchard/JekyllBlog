I travel a fair amount, and often to more than one destination so this is built around that. </p>
    <p>The first thing I do is decide where I'm going and when I'll go there. Then the Workflow puts together the start of a "before I go" list - including entries such as booking time off work, booking flights, charging battery packs, etc. The next step is to choose if this is a one or a multiple destination trip, if it's just one location then I add a few entries for that - planning travel to and from the airport, things to do, and so on. If it's a multi destination trip then I have to tell the app which places I'm going and in what order, and it generates a series of tasks based on that. The last thing the template does is to add packing categories to my project, I keep my actual packing lists in TripList as it has a wizard which generates a list for me (I could replicate that in Workflow of course!) - and syncs things to my TripIt plans.</p>
    <p>The taskpaper result for a one destination trip looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code>2018/08 - Belgium:
        - Book time off work 11/08/2018 - 14/08/2018
        - Book flights to Belgium
        - Plan travel to the airport for 11/08/2018
        - Plan travel home from the airport for 14/08/2018
        - Make a packing list
        - Pack
        - Charge battery pack
        - Charge headphones
        - Put films &amp; TV shows on iPad
        - Book accommodation for Belgium
        - Plan travel from the airport to accommodation (11/08/2018)
        - Plan travel from the accommodation to the airport (14/08/2018)
        - Plan things to do in Belgium
        - Packing
            - Clothing
            - Documents
            - Electronics
            - Miscellaneous
            - Hand luggage</code></pre>
    <p>And for a multiple destination trip you end up with this:</p>
    <pre><code>2018/08 - Belgium / Netherlands:
        - Book time off work 11/08/2018 - 18/08/2018
        - Book flights to Belgium
        - Plan travel to the airport for 11/08/2018
        - Plan travel home from the airport for 18/08/2018
        - Make a packing list
        - Pack
        - Charge battery pack
        - Charge headphones
        - Put films &amp; TV shows on iPad
        - Belgium @autodone(true) @parallel(true)
            - Book accommodation for Belgium
            - Plan travel from the airport to accommodation
            - Plan things to do in Belgium
        - Netherlands @autodone(true) @parallel(true)
            - Plan travel from Belgium to Netherlands (14/08/2018)
            - Book accommodation for Netherlands
            - Plan things to do in Netherlands
        - Packing
            - Clothing
            - Documents
            - Electronics
            - Miscellaneous
            - Hand luggage</code></pre>
    <p>As you can see there's not much of a difference - just the division and repetition of some tasks. </p>
    <p>You can get the workflow here: <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/7311f351577f41a2bfba7fd755ec9812">OmniFocus Travel Plans</a></p>
    <p>If you look at that Workflow and think that it's too complicated and I'm crazy (possible), then I also have a <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/9e1ee05ca67e43cbb23093b6999863f3">simple version</a> for one destination which you can get here: <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/9e1ee05ca67e43cbb23093b6999863f3">OmniFocus Travel Plans - Simple</a></p>";}}
