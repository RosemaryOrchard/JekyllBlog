    <p>The Apple Watch has several new features will encourage members of my family to upgrade as well as myself. I bought my grandmother an Apple Watch after she had a nasty fall a few years ago and shattered her hip - my thinking was the SOS function would be useful for her, but now I would very much appreciate it if she had the automatic fall detection too. The low heart rate detection and ECG feature will be very handy for my father has there are hereditary heart problems in his family, plus he complains that the screen is too small so more screen will definitely go down well there. I'm very pleased that all the watch bands I've collected so far will continue to fit as well - I do like to co-ordinate the straps with my outfit!</p>
    <p>The iPhone updates look pretty nice too, though I'm most intrigued by the NFC update which will allow apps to be triggered through NFC - as Tim Chaten said to me on Twitter this seems like it could be a big win for automation:</p>
