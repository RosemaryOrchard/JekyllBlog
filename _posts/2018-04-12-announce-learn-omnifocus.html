<p><a href="https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/announce-learn-omnifocus/learn-omnifocus.png){.image-right"><img class="alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/04/learn-omnifocus.png" /></a>I’m very honoured to have been invited to present my OmniFocus workflows on <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/?ref=16">Learn OmniFocus</a> with Tim Stringer. The session will be live on May 23rd, and you can <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/live/2018-05-23-omnifocus-workflows-with-rose-orchard/?ref=16">sign up for it now</a>. As well as showing how I use OmniFocus I’ll also be demonstrating some of my <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/tag:workflow">Workflow workflows</a> and automation that I use every day.</p>
<p>For those of you not familiar with Learn OmniFocus, it’s a great site with <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/articles/?ref=16">articles</a>, <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/videos/?ref=16">videos</a> and more which will help you learn about OmniFocus. You can see some examples from <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/recordings/omnifocus-workflow-guests/?ref=16">previous workflow guests</a> if you want to get an idea of what my session will be like. If you’re a member there’s plenty of extra goodies too like AppleScripts - including the ability to watch my session live and chat with everyone before and after but the chat sessions won’t be included.</p>
<p>I hope to see some of you there!</p>
