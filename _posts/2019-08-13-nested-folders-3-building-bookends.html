I also trick Scotty into doing maths, and most important of all: Scotty has a new mic.</p>
<p>On top of this, to celebrate episode 3 we're also having a competition: listen in for details on how to win a year of OmniFocus Pro and a copy of <a href="https://omnifocusbook.com">Build Your OmniFocus Workflow</a>.</p>
