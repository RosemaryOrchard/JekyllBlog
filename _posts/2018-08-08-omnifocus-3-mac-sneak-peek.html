  >I am once again lucky enough to be in the early preview for OmniFocus 3 -
  this time on the Mac! What's important to keep in mind here is that this is a
  beta, and an early one at that - things can and likely will change between me
  writing this post and OmniFocus 3 for Mac being released - they may have
  already changed by the time you read this post!
</p>

<h3>Stability</h3>
<p>
  This is a beta app so there's no guarantees, for me the app has been very
  stable - but I'm also running it on High Sierra. However as the builds can
  literally be released every few hours (depending on what is being added or
  changed) this could change at the drop of a hat - so be warned ðŸ˜‰.
</p>
<h3>The Icon</h3>
<p>
  We have the sketch icon again! It's cute, and helpful to distinguish between
  the two apps in your dock. Personally I put OmniFocus 2 in a folder in
  Applications called "OmniFocus 2" and the beta in a folder called "OmniFocus
  3" (yes, I <em>was</em> feeling creative, however did you guessâ€½). This means
  if you launch the app via spotlight you get a helpful text hint about which
  version of the app you're launching too.

<h3>Forecast View</h3>
<p>
  Interleaved tasks and calendar events have made their way to the Mac in the
  forecast view. This is really handy for putting my day together and I'm a big
  fan of this on iOS.
</p>

<p>
  I find this view much more beneficial than the gantt style view in OmniFocus
  2, just because it brings everything together.
</p>
<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>
  OmniFocus looks different now, for example the toolbar across the top is much
  slimmer and by default includes fewer actions - though as always you can
  customise it by right clicking on it to add more options. The sidebar where
  the perspectives (and any starred custom perspectives) are listed, as well as
  the area where the project or tag list is shown have a dark background too,
  which I find helps me focus on the tasks area - the important things!

<p>
  One place where you can see some subtle, but effective changes to the design
  is in the inspector. For example the status of the selected item has changed
  from a dropdown to segmented controls - the iOS equivalent of radio buttons
  (you have probably seen these in the maps app, to say that you want to see a
  map, transit, or satellite view). Tags of course have changed too, so that you
  could see multiple tags which are assigned to the current item at the same
  time.

</p>
<h3>Repeats</h3>
<p>
  In OmniFocus 3 for iOS we got custom repeats, and these have been brought over
  to the Mac as well. The place where this really shows is in the monthly where
  you can specify that a task should repeat on day <code>X</code> of the month,
  or you can specify a repeat on the <code>y</code>th <code>z</code>day of each
  month (e.g. the second Tuesday). These repeats have come in very handy for me
  - for example I submit my timesheet for last month on the first Monday of the
  next month.

  /></a>
</p>
<h3>Custom Perspectives</h3>
<p>
  Another feature we're now seeing on the Mac is enhanced custom perspectives.
  You can build these by nesting rules - if you've used Hazel or created smart
  folders in Finder then you'll be familiar with creating the rules (click the
  <code>+</code> to add a new one), and you can press <code>ALT</code>+<code
    >+</code
  >
  to add a nested rule. A new feature here that's not yet on iOS is the ability
  to change the overarching rule, on iOS it defaults to "all of", and this can
  be changed to "any of" or "none of" in the new Mac version - though at the
  time of writing this doesn't yet sync to iOS.

  I'm very excited about the new OmniFocus 3 for Mac, and really looking forward
  to seeing how it evolves throughout the beta process!
