    I am once again lucky enough to be in the early preview for OmniFocus 3 - this
    time on the Mac! What's important to keep in mind here is that this is a beta,
    and an early one at that - things can and likely will change between me writing
    this post and OmniFocus 3 for Mac being released - they may have already changed
    by the time you read this post!</p>\n<h3>Stability</h3>\n<p>This is a beta app
    so there's no guarantees, for me the app has been very stable - but I'm also running
    it on High Sierra. However as the builds can literally be released every few hours
    (depending on what is being added or changed) this could change at the drop of
    a hat - so be warned \U0001F609.</p>\n<h3>The Icon</h3>\n<p>We have the sketch
    icon again! It's cute, and helpful to distinguish between the two apps in your
    dock. Personally I put OmniFocus 2 in a folder in Applications called \"OmniFocus
    2\" and the beta in a folder called \"OmniFocus 3\" (yes, I <em>was</em> feeling
    creative, however did you guessâ€½). This means if you launch the app via spotlight
    you get a helpful text hint about which version of the app you're launching too.</p>\n<p><a

    View</h3>\n<p>Interleaved tasks and calendar events have made their way to the
    Mac in the forecast view. This is really handy for putting my day together and
    I'm a big fan of this on iOS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-forecast-view.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400\">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-forecast-view.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400</a>)\n<a
    href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-2-forecast-view.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400\">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-2-forecast-view.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400</a>)</p>\n<p>I
    find this view much more beneficial than the gantt style view in OmniFocus 2,
    just because it brings everything together.</p>\n<h3>Appearance</h3>\n<p>OmniFocus
    looks different now, for example the toolbar across the top is much slimmer and
    by default includes fewer actions - though as always you can customise it by right
    clicking on it to add more options. The sidebar where the perspectives (and any
    starred custom perspectives) are listed, as well as the area where the project
    or tag list is shown have a dark background too, which I find helps me focus on
    the tasks area - the important things!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-project-view.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400\">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-project-view.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400</a>)\n<a
    href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-2-project-view.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400\">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-2-project-view.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400</a>)</p>\n<p>One
    place where you can see some subtle, but effective changes to the design is in
    the inspector. For example the status of the selected item has changed from a
    dropdown to segmented controls - the iOS equivalent of radio buttons (you have
    probably seen these in the maps app, to say that you want to see a map, transit,
    or satellite view). Tags of course have changed too, so that you could see multiple
    tags which are assigned to the current item at the same time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-task-inspector.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400\">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-task-inspector.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400</a>)\n<a

    OmniFocus 3 for iOS we got custom repeats, and these have been brought over to
    the Mac as well. The place where this really shows is in the monthly where you
    can specify that a task should repeat on day <code>X</code> of the month, or you
    can specify a repeat on the <code>y</code>th <code>z</code>day of each month (e.g.
    the second Tuesday). These repeats have come in very handy for me - for example
    I submit my timesheet for last month on the first Monday of the next month.</p>\n<p><a

    Perspectives</h3>\n<p>Another feature we're now seeing on the Mac is enhanced
    custom perspectives. You can build these by nesting rules - if you've used Hazel
    or created smart folders in Finder then you'll be familiar with creating the rules
    (click the <code>+</code> to add a new one), and you can press <code>ALT</code>+<code>+</code>
    to add a nested rule. A new feature here that's not yet on iOS is the ability
    to change the overarching rule, on iOS it defaults to \"all of\", and this can
    be changed to \"any of\" or \"none of\" in the new Mac version - though at the
    time of writing this doesn't yet sync to iOS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-custom-perspectives.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400\">https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-custom-perspectives.png?lightbox=1024&amp;cropResize=400x400</a>)\n<a

    seeing how it evolves throughout the beta process!</p>\";}}"
