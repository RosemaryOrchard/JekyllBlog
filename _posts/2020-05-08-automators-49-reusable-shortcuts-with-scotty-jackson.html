  In today's episode of Automators, Scotty Jackson, my co-host on
  <a href="http://nestedfolderspodcast.com/">Nested Folders</a> crossed over
  into the parallel universe of automation to talk to David and myself about how
  he's using Shortcuts to log, commuicate, and even handle complex project
  management across multiple systems!
