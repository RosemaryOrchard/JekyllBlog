<p>I’ve talked about my Mu One charger on a few podcasts so I was excited today to see they’re launching the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/muone/mu-two-next-generation-63w-dual-usb-type-c-wall-charger?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=Mu%20Two">Mu Two</a> on Kickstarter. I’ve backed it because a two port USB C charger with switchable heads deserves a place in my travel tech line up!</p>
