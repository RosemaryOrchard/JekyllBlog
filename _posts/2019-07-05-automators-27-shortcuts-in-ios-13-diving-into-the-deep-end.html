  In Automators 27 David and I did the thing we do best: ignore all the advice,
  install the betas, suffer for it, but in the end we got you the goods on
  Shortcuts in iOS 13 and what it's <em>really</em> like!

  One of the things we love in this new version of Shortcuts is the replacement
  of <code>Get Variable</code> with this new sentence format in each action.

  I know in the episode I said I would do a video on this, but I think these
  screenshots explain it much better than a video would have! It's now much
  easier to see what you're working with - and that's better for everyone from
  Shortcuts super nerds to people just poking around who find it installed on
  their devices after they update the OS in September.

<p>
  I hope you enjoy listening to the episode - David and I are both running
  developer beta 3 now!

  One note: I said in the episode that I wasn't able to run Shortcuts from
  notifications (e.g. with triggers like time) - beta 3 resolved this.
