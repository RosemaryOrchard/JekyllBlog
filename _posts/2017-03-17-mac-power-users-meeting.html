<p>This week the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu">Mac Power Users podcast</a> hosted a meet up in Chicago. The event was sponsored by <a href="http://macpaw.com">MacPaw</a> (delicious food, thanks guys!), and it was a lot of fun. </p>
<p>Along with meeting <a href="https://katiefloyd.com">Katie</a> and <a href="https://www.macsparky.com">David</a>, I also met <a href="http://ilc.com">Tom Siko</a>, <a href="http://mcnary.me">Joshua McNary</a>, <a href="http://www.themactutor.com">Tony Marengo</a>, and many others. <a href="http://leancrew.com">Dr Drang</a> was apparently in the room too, however as he was anonymous I couldn't say how much I appreciate his script sharing on his blog. </p>
<p>I didn't go just for the appetisers of course, it was lots of fun to meet everyone, and I even got a t-shirt! </p>
