I've teamed up with Tim Stringer to produce automation focused content for his site <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/?ref=16">Learn OmniFocus</a>. </p>
    <p>This weekend Tim is offering 25% off annual membership, and on top of that he is donating 20% of the income from this to CARE Canada (<a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/black-friday-giving-tuesday-2018/?ref=16">get the details here</a> - make sure to get the coupon code!).</p>
    <p>In the first session Tim and I have planned I'm going to get you started with OmniFocus and Siri Shortcuts - triggering OmniFocus perspectives with your voice, and building simple Shortcuts. We already have a second session planned for January too where we'll dive deeper into what Shortcuts can automate in OmniFocus for you.</p>
    <p>There's some other great sessions coming up too:</p>

On top of this you get to attend Learn OmniFocus office hours where you can sit down with Tim and a few others for a confidential discussion about your system and ways you want to improve it.</p>
    <p>I hope to see you at some of these sessions!</p>";}}
