I recently discovered a little trick from the Map app in iOS - that you can add a rich contact to your contact, complete with map.

1. The first step is finding the place on the map - Apple Maps has got much better over the years so points of interest and useful places like doctors surgeries are often searchable by name.

2. Then you need to choose to either add a new contact, or add this information to an existing contact.

?resize=400)  
3. Once this is done you have an enhanced contact - complete with mini map, and any other information that is attached to that place in Maps - so here we have opening hours and more.
