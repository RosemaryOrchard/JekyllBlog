I recently joined the team at TWiT and will be releasing iOS Today weekly with the lovely Mikah Sargant! This week was our first show, so of course, we had to take a look at my top 10 apps: Shortcuts, OmniFocus, Drafts, Carrot Weather, Apollo, Cardhop, Widgetsmith, NetNewsWire, Yoink, Pushcut</p>
<p>We also covered news: Guided audio walking workouts may be coming to Apple Watch. After claiming it was working with Apple on its car project, Hyundai has reversed course. A new iPad Pro with a mini-LED display may be coming in March. After more rumors of Apple's AirTags, accessory makers seem to be working on products for the Find My devices.</p>

<p>And then some listener feedback: iPad purchasing advice, THE {} AND relationship app, and installing a VPN at the router level.</p>
<p>Finally, we rounded off the show with our App Caps: <a href="http://apple.co/3s9fuDZ">Doubletake</a> and <a href="https://apple.co/399wgKF">Textcraft</a>.</p>
