<p>The Mac Power Users community which I have been helping to moderate has a wonderful new home on Discourse. The Facebook group has been archived (which means it is still there, but in read only mode), and <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com">talk.macpowerusers.com</a> is already exceedingly popular. I know a large number of the Mac Power Users fans are not Facebook users and hope that they will join this community.</p>
