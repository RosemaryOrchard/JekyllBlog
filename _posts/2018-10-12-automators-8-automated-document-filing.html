<p>Episode 8 of automators is all about filing documents automatically. We we said in the episode, one of the keys to success is good naming and structure - and I made a screencast which shows you how you can use Keyboard Maestro to rename files in a specific format that we need for our project slides at work - with incrementing numbers in the <em>middle</em> of the document name.</p>
