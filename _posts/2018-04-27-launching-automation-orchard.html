<p><a href="https://automationorchard.com">Automation Orchard</a> is where I've collected every article, podcast and even video I've found regarding any automation topic related to Apple, from Workflow to IFTTT, and Automator to AppleScript. It doesn't have everything - yet, but it has a lot. So if you were trying to find a Workflow workflow to work with Trello, you could search and find a lot of options. All of this content links back to the original website. </p>

<p>There's also a forum, this is split up into sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn - housing lessons, challenges, and questions based on language.</li>
<li>Mac - for questions and posts about automating things on your Mac, including using AppleScript, Keyboard Maestro, et. al.</li>
<li>iOS - for automation on iOS, including Workflow and more.</li>
<li>Web - the place to talk about IFTTT, Zapier, Microsoft Flow, and other cool web automation services.</li>
<li>Home - where you can discuss home automation.</li>
<li>General - for everything else.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? I love to automate, I love to help people automate. The website has become my Wikipedia - if I want to find a DEVONThink Workflow then I know where to search, and I know I'll probably find helpful related content too. </p>
<p>The forum only has a few posts in it right now - started by me. I hope to see many of you there, asking questions, sharing your automations, and discussing why we automate!</p>
<p>My personal posts will still appear here - <a href="https://automationorchard.com">Automation Orchard</a> is to collect content from around the web, including from here! There will be some blog posts there too - predominantly about the why of automation, you can check out the first post <a href="https://automationorchard.com/blog/welcome">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>P.S. Yes, the name is a play on my name and the focus on Apple!</em></p>
