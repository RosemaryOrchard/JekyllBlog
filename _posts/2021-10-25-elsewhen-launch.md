Time is hard, and moreso when you and your friends are spread out around the world. Fortunately, technology can help us handle these things!

Discord has a feature where if you paste a time code with specific formatting, it displays it in the local timezone for each user, but creating these manually is cumbersone - and prone to error. So some [friends of mine](https://tildy.dev) pooled their skills and made a little app to do it, [Elsewhen](https://apps.apple.com/app/elsewhen/id1588708173). Whilst it was in beta, [Myke Hurley](http://twitter.com/imyke) asked for a format to share times formatted for his [Friday Keyboard Club](https://twitter.com/imyke/status/1450853405740699651), which is a list of times with an emoji flag to indicate the timezone - and within what seemed like no time, the app gained "Myke Mode"! (Officially known as "Time List", but in my heart, and the source code, it's called Myke Mode.)

The app is out now and [free to download](https://apps.apple.com/app/elsewhen/id1588708173)!
