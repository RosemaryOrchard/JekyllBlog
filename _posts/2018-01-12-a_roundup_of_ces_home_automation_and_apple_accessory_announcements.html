<p>There are several products in this roundup that I'm interested in, the power sleeve is a great idea and would have been ideal for me in a past life, and the HyperDrive is something I would love on my desk at work now. What I'm most interested in though is how long these items take to make their way to Europe - Fibaro are usually good there at least.</p>
