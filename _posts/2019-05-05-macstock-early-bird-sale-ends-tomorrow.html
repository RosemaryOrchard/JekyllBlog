<p>Just a quick reminder that I'm going to be speaking at MacStock in July, and that the early bird sale ends tomorrow! Use the code <strong>rosemary</strong> to get a discount. You can still use the code after tomorrow, but as the price goes up... ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>My talk is all about <em>Sirifying your iOS life</em>. I'll be demoing how to use Siri Shortcuts effectively, as well as how to build Shortcuts to give you an effective personal assistant! You can see a full <a href="https://macstockconferenceandexpo.com/schedule/">schedule at the MacStock website</a>.</p>
