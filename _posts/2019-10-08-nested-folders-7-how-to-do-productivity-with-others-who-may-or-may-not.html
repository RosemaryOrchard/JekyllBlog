  Working with other people can be a challenge, and not everyone likes to wave
  their productivity system around so we often don't know how they get things
  done! In this episode Scotty and I talked about how to work with others -
  whether or not we have a productivity system, how we can learn from them, and
  what to do to make sure the work gets done.
