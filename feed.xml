		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/smart-home-documentation/">&lt;p&gt;There was a post on the Home Assistant subreddit today asking &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/10884ky/documenting_smart_home/&quot;&gt;how people document their smart homes&lt;/a&gt;. As I took a little bit of time to write up my response and include some links I thought it would be worth sharing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; to document setup/installation processes, my network, and similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, my network note has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes#Diagram&quot;&gt;Mermaid diagram&lt;/a&gt; for approximate layout (router, switches, and devices have their own shapes, lines connect ethernet devices, wifi devices aren‚Äôt on the diagram), and a table with names, MAC addresses and DHCP assigned IPs of devices as well as wifi vs ethernet. The table is generated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview&quot;&gt;Dataview&lt;/a&gt; from a subfolder of device notes. I only document ethernet devices and wifi devices that are ‚Äúimportant‚Äù (e.g. smart home devices that all show up on the router as Espressif will get noted so if I set my network config on fire then I don‚Äôt have to trial and error my way through setting it all up again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The device notes contain the name, IP, MAC Address, approximate description (if needed) and so on. For more complex devices it also contains which OS is installed, and containers/services are running on the device as well as install instructions (e.g. Plex is installed straight onto my Plex server). Install instructions are just a numbered list, with links out to relevant instruction pages/forum posts (which I do my best to remember to throw into archive.org when I add the link to my note so it should be there in the future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker compose files as well as related config for containers are all backed up to a private git repo, there‚Äôs a folder for each physical machine I use, and a readme with a note about the folder structure I‚Äôm using and anything important I might forget (such as why X container is using host networking). I could reverse engineer folder structure from the compose files, but why bother? üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve just added another private git repo for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://esphome.io/&quot;&gt;ESPHome&lt;/a&gt; configs, not that they need to be private, but if I screw up and put credentials into the YAML instead of secrets then it‚Äôs less worrisome üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important part of my system is backups though. I back everything up, and get it off the device, as well as  another copy off my network: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/&quot;&gt;3-2-1 rule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/pushcut-run-make-automation/">&lt;p&gt;One of the many things I do with Make is ‚Äúclean up‚Äù a number of tables in various Airtable bases (i.e. remove records which are no longer needed), delete/archive some Google Documents, and similar. This is an automation which I wanted to integrate into a number of other automations, but also to be able to run it in an adhoc fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022/shortcuts_check_calendar_make.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to this was to use a webhook as the trigger. I can run the Make scenario through any other Make (or IFTTT/Zapier) automation through a simple HTTP request to that webhook. But then I stumbled across another scenario: I wanted to run this automatically the day after I record any podcast. Instead of trying to set up multiple automations involving each of the 4 calendars I use for podcasting (one for each podcast, plus another for any podcasts I guest on), I turned to Pushcut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day at midnight Pushcut runs an action which gets my calendars events for the last day filtered to just those for calendars. If there were any events, it calls the webhook to run the tidy up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs very simple, 3 actions, but it‚Äôs a great way to re-use that same automation as a component. If I need something else tidied up regularly I can add it to that one Make scenario and voil√†.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/keyboard-maestro-label-maker/">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/automators-097/&quot;&gt;most recent episode of Automators&lt;/a&gt; was how I‚Äôve been fixing small annoyances with automation tools, particularly Keyboard Maestro. I encountered another one with my label maker which I was happy to be able to solve!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Brother P-Touch PT710BT label maker. Naming aside, it‚Äôs an excellent device‚Äîand the Brother software on the Mac allows me to do a mail merge with CSVs‚Äîincluding print a list of labels. Collecting the list and merging that into a CSV is a Shortcuts story for another time, but the thing that annoyed me the most is connecting the label maker to my Mac didn‚Äôt automatically open the software. It was just &lt;em&gt;one more step&lt;/em&gt; getting in my way. So I fixed it‚Äîwith Keyboard Maestro.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keyboard Maestro has a trigger for &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/trigger/USB_Device&quot;&gt;connecting USB devices&lt;/a&gt;. Because I‚Äôm me, I didn‚Äôt check the documentation when I went to set this up, so I found the name of the trigger the hard way‚Äîthrough the Apple Menu, System Report, USB, and then scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022/macos_usb_devices.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Label Maker in the System Report&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The macro is very simple: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Activate &quot;Brother P-touch Editor&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. One action. But it works! And that‚Äôs one less annoyance in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022/keyboard-maestro-activate-application.png&quot; alt=&quot;Keyboard Maestro Macro to activate the label maker software when the device is connected&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;As well as diving into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://relay.fm/automators/97&quot;&gt;whole bunch of geeky awesomeness&lt;/a&gt;, we also launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/membership&quot;&gt;Automators Max&lt;/a&gt; which is part of the Relay FM membership program. As well as ad free episodes of Automators and a members only after show (this time it‚Äôs about me hacking some door sensors), you‚Äôll also get access to the Relay FM member‚Äôs only Discord server, access to Crossover with member‚Äôs only Relay FM special episodes, exclusive wallpapers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the things I mentioned was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-assistant.io&quot;&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; which I‚Äôve really been getting into. The automations are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more powerful than those available in HomeKit‚Äîfor example, I can finally turn my heating off if my door has been open for a minute or longer (with the door being open for a minute as the trigger), instead of checking a few times over the span of the minute if the door is open and then turning it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve talked David into ordering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/09/13/home-assistant-yellow/&quot;&gt;Home Assistant Yellow&lt;/a&gt; and plan to drag him down that rabbit hole and give this a whirl once that arrives! In the mean time though, if you‚Äôre curious, I‚Äôve started putting up my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RosemaryOrchard/home-assistant-config&quot;&gt;Home Assistant Configuration&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. There‚Äôs no documentation (yet!), but you can see some of what I‚Äôm doing!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/rocketbook-and-pens/">&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/automators/96&quot;&gt;latest episode of Automators&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://mikah.co&quot;&gt;Mikah Sargent&lt;/a&gt;, we went down a little bit of a rabbit hole with my RocketBook. After the show, both Sparky and Mikah decided to give it a try! Since then I‚Äôve been contacted by a few people asking about my RocketBook, so here are the full details.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022/rocketbook.png&quot; alt=&quot;RocketBook and Pilot Frixion Fineliners and Markers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3Hnq5lf&quot;&gt;RocketBook Core&lt;/a&gt;, in A4 dot grid. A4 is big enough that I have plenty of space to draw out diagrams, and the dot grid lets me draw and write neatly, without lines getting in my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a combination of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3poiHzX&quot;&gt;Pilot Frixion Fineliners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/357QcQh&quot;&gt;Pilot Frixion Markers&lt;/a&gt;. These are a bit thicker than the Pilot Frixion rollerball that comes with the RocketBook pack, but I find this works better for my handwriting‚Äîand the ink is much easier to erase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erasing is easy, you just use a microfibre cloth (one comes with the RocketBook), and some water. I keep a small spray bottle of tap water in my office for plants, and cleaning my RocketBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs something incredibly satisfying about finishing something and then erasing your notes afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Discord has a feature where if you paste a time code with specific formatting, it displays it in the local timezone for each user, but creating these manually is cumbersone - and prone to error. So some &lt;a href=&quot;https://tildy.dev&quot;&gt;friends of mine&lt;/a&gt; pooled their skills and made a little app to do it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/app/elsewhen/id1588708173&quot;&gt;Elsewhen&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst it was in beta, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/imyke&quot;&gt;Myke Hurley&lt;/a&gt; asked for a format to share times formatted for his &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/imyke/status/1450853405740699651&quot;&gt;Friday Keyboard Club&lt;/a&gt;, which is a list of times with an emoji flag to indicate the timezone - and within what seemed like no time, the app gained ‚ÄúMyke Mode‚Äù! (Officially known as ‚ÄúTime List‚Äù, but in my heart, and the source code, it‚Äôs called Myke Mode.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is out now and &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/app/elsewhen/id1588708173&quot;&gt;free to download&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  I recently joined the team at TWiT and will be releasing iOS Today weekly with
  the lovely Mikah Sargant! This week was our first show, so of course, we had
  to take a look at my top 10 apps: Shortcuts, OmniFocus, Drafts, Carrot
  Weather, Apollo, Cardhop, Widgetsmith, NetNewsWire, Yoink, Pushcut
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  We also covered news: Guided audio walking workouts may be coming to Apple
  Watch. After claiming it was working with Apple on its car project, Hyundai
  has reversed course. A new iPad Pro with a mini-LED display may be coming in
  March. After more rumors of Apple's AirTags, accessory makers seem to be
  working on products for the Find My devices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And then some listener feedback: iPad purchasing advice, THE {} AND
  relationship app, and installing a VPN at the router level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Finally, we rounded off the show with our App Caps:
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.co/3s9fuDZ&quot;&gt;Doubletake&lt;/a&gt; and
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://apple.co/399wgKF&quot;&gt;Textcraft&lt;/a&gt;.

  feedback when things are broken on iOS (as some actions break in Shortcuts
  from time to time!), and reviewed our Streamdeck setup and more.

&lt;p&gt;
  While recording the show I thought I'd found a way to generate URLs to
  specific views in Airtable through a formula, but it turns out I had links to

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-43-capture-and-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automators 43: Capture and Review" />
	  <published>2020-02-14T23:47:22+00:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-43-capture-and-review</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-43-capture-and-review/">&lt;p&gt;
  In this episode of Autmators, David and I took a headlong plunge into
  automating our capture and review processes. As we mentioned on the show,
  automated capture is a double-edged sword - capturing too much can lead to
  overwhelm, but I also find automated capture to be a problem solver as then I
  don't have to do the actual capturing myself, something that could be
  dangerous!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Since we recorded the show I've been experimenting even more with Pushcut and
  the automation server to create projects in OmniFocus. It's not ready to share
  yet, but I'm working on that!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For me, the biggest automation and productivity win recently has come from
  looking at review. I'm building an automated review of both tasks due today,
  tasks tagged with my Forecast tag, and tasks completed today into different
  parts of my day. This is really keeping me on top of things and things are
  slipping through the cracks less and less now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'm also very glad that David is experimenting with the Shortcuts home screen
  again. I'm still not completely sold on this for myself, but there are several
  use cases where I can see myself benefitting. For the time being I'm working
  on using LaunchCuts to set up a good folder structure - and I've added a few
  Shortcuts to my home screen which just open specific folders. This means I
  only have to maintain the folders in one place, and with the smart folders
  this is pretty easy to do.

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-41-automated-health-tracking/">&lt;p&gt;
  In this week's episode of Automators, David and I dove into health tracking.
  As it's the start of the year I've been trying to figure out what my health
  goals are - but I couldn't let them get away from me without a little
  automation!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  After we recorded I stumbled across
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://chartyios.app/&quot;&gt;Charty&lt;/a&gt;, an app in beta which like many
  new apps popping up on my radar at the moment, is designed to integrate with
  Shortcuts. This one is, as you may guess from the name, designed to help you
  create charts with data. I've not yet figured out how to give it health data
  to make a chart (I suspect I need to split the times and data points first),
  but I'll be experimenting with this over the next few weeks!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One of my favourite things to do with Shortcuts, is to make &quot;dumb&quot; devices
  smart. I've helped my parents track blood pressure and blood glucose, as well
  as added Health integration to my FitBit scales, all with just a few
  Shortcuts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I hope you enjoy the 41st episode of Automators:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://relay.fm/automators/41&quot;&gt;Automated Health Tracking&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;Today I'm excited to announce my new book: &lt;em&gt;Take Control of Shortcuts&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortcuts is a handy app, but even with examples it can be hard to know where to begin. People have asked me if I could recommend a guide to Shortcuts to them, and this book is my answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It explains everything, from the user interface basics and essential terminology, to building and debugging your own complex shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book includes 15 example shortcuts with exact steps to build them and download links for each. There are also chapters on working with APIs, as well as complementary applications you can use to enhance your Shortcuts experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take Control of Shortcuts&lt;/em&gt; is part of the fabulous Take Control series. It‚Äôs a privilege to join the ranks of their knowledgeable and experienced authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the book. I've enjoyed writing it and hope that everyone can learn something new from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the book at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/shortcuts/&quot;&gt;Take Control&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/managing-my-reference-material-with-devonthink-omnifocus-and-shortcuts/">&lt;p&gt;Reference material is a big challenge, and I find if I don‚Äôt set myself up for success from the beginning, then I am most definitely doomed to fail. I found DEVONthink some years ago and really like it for managing my reference material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized a while ago that creating a place to store material related to a project when I create my project is critical‚Äîif it doesn‚Äôt happen then, when will it happen? As I have a strong tendency to reach for my iPad or my iPhone rather than a Mac, I solved this problem with a little help from Shortcuts and X-Callback URLs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you import the shortcut, it asks you for a DEVONthink destination. I keep all of my project material in one database, so I used that as my destination. You could also use a group - or remove the destination components entirely to put everything in the global inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/12/5518B066-B2A7-4AC9-8C02-D478EF85F295.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Copy the item link in DEVONThink so you can get the ID for Shortcuts.&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Copy the item link in DEVONthink so you can get the ID for Shortcuts.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run the shortcut, it asks you for a name, you can cheat and add lots of names though (use a return to separate them), and it will run through each item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each one, you can choose if this is a project or a task. For projects, the shortcut automatically creates a group, and for a task, you get the choice of markdown, text, or a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortcut creates the DEVONthink item first, then creates the project or task in OmniFocus with a link back to the DEVONthink destination in the note. It‚Äôs a simple system but works well for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5d6102a575c1464a8ec9e840c44a1bac&quot;&gt;DEVONthink And OmniFocus here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/drafts-action-fix-empty-markdown-links/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Drafts Action: Fix Empty Markdown Links" />
	  <published>2019-12-08T21:51:56+00:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/drafts-action-fix-empty-markdown-links</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/drafts-action-fix-empty-markdown-links/">&lt;p&gt;
  As is often the case, as I use Drafts I find things that I need to do and
  write a script to fix it for me! In this case, I have a habit of planning to
  add links later in my text, but find it a pain to go through the whole article
  to find them and the find function is too darn &lt;em&gt;manual&lt;/em&gt; for me. There
  were already a few actions in the Actions Directory, but they didn't quite
  work the way I wanted them to. If you haven't guessed where this is going yet:
  I wrote my own!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  This action using the Script function in Drafts, and some good old
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/automators/34&quot;&gt;regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;. The code
  itself can be broken down into eight steps:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the contents of the Draft.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create the regular expression.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Parse the contents of the Draft with the regular expression to get a list of
    &lt;code&gt;matches&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a prompt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add each match to the prompt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show the prompt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Go through each match again and replace it (within the whole content) with
    the information provided through the prompt.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update the draft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;let content = draft.content; //get the content of the draft

let pattern = /\[[^\]]+]\(\)/g; //build the regex

let matches = content.match(pattern); //find all the empty links

//create the prompt
let p = Prompt.create();
p.title = &quot;Missing Links&quot;;

//add each empty link to the prompt
matches.forEach(function (match, index){
    p.addTextField(index, match.replace('[', '').replace(']()', ''), &quot;&quot;);
});

//show the prompt
p.addButton(&quot;OK&quot;);
let didSelect = p.show();

//if the prompt wasn't cancelled
if (didSelect) {
    if (p.buttonPressed == &quot;OK&quot;) {
        //go through each empty link and replace it with the updated information
        Object.keys(p.fieldValues).forEach(function (index) {
            content = content.replace(matches[index], matches[index].replace('()', '('+p.fieldValues[index]+')'))
        });
    }
}

//update the draft
draft.content = content;
draft.update();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  The idea is I can run this at the end of writing, deal with all my links in
  one prompt, and get on with things. It's the kind of action I'll include as a
  step in other actions to make sure I don't accidentally post empty links!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/11o&quot;
    &gt;Get it from the action directory&lt;/a
  &gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/keeping-track-of-my-someday-maybe-tasks-with-git/">&lt;p&gt;
  Someday and maybe tasks and projects are one of those things where I can never
  seem to find the perfect system. I‚Äôve tried putting these things in OmniFocus
  and tagging them, using Trello (which I still use, but for different purposes)
  and I know there has been more than one paper planner over the years!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Some of you may be asking ‚Äúwhat is a someday maybe task?‚Äù. The name comes from
  Getting Things Done by David Allen, the idea is something is a task or project
  you want to do, but you can‚Äôt work on it right now - so you put it on a list
  called ‚ÄúSomeday/Maybe‚Äù to get around to when the time is right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  A few months ago I turned to Git to try and solve my problem. There were a few
  features I knew I wanted from a system:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Some interoperability with OmniFocus to make it easy to take things out as
    well as put things back in, or something I could easily script.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The ability to track what changed, when, and optionally &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; .
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to tweak my system easily without rebuilding it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automation options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- [ ] This is a sample task in the format I started with
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I started in Drafts, using the task format. This is nice and visual but
  doesn‚Äôt offer all the other features I wanted without setting up lots of
  actions and cobbling things together. Drafts has versions - which satisfies my
  want to be able to look back in time, but it lacks explicit change messages
  connected to these. While Drafts is the right tool for many jobs, it wasn‚Äôt
  quite what I was looking for here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Next, I did some digging around and stumbled across my old friends
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/&quot;&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt; and
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.textasticapp.com&quot;&gt;Textastic&lt;/a&gt;. These are my preferred
  text-based file editing apps on macOS and iOS, but alone neither of them
  really hit the spot - until I decided to take some lessons from the
  professional side of my life and use Version Control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Version Control systems are designed for programming, so you can track who
  changed what, when, and assuming they wrote a decent commit message to
  accompany the change, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. There are quite a few services out there
  offering these, I chose to use Git and to use GitLab for this. (That said, the
  sample to accompany this blog post is on GitHub because I know most people are
  more familiar with that!)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now, I can make a change to my Someday/Maybe lists from any device, including
  the web, and just type why I changed it. Version control, in this case, Git,
  automatically stores what changed and when. You can even do a diff, compare
  two files side by side so see exactly what was added or removed!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now it‚Äôs time to get into the nitty-gritty! Let‚Äôs start with the apps. As
  mentioned above, on macOS I use BBEdit, this has Git integration so I can
  theoretically do everything with that. That said, sometimes I switch up my
  apps so I also have
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sourcetreeapp.com&quot;&gt;SourceTree&lt;/a&gt; around to handle the
  Git stuff. I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use the command line, but I usually don‚Äôt want to.
  On iOS I use two apps
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://workingcopyapp.com&quot;&gt;Working Copy&lt;/a&gt; and Textastic. There‚Äôs
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.textasticapp.com/v8/manual/integration_other_apps/git_client_working_copy.html&quot;
    &gt;good documentation on how to connect the two of them together&lt;/a
  &gt;
  so I won‚Äôt go into detail on that here. To be clear, I use Working Copy for
  the Git side of things and Textastic for the writing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Next up: Files. I have two primary lists, Someday and Maybe. Someday is ‚ÄúI
  really want to do this and will make time for it, but that time is not now‚Äù,
  whereas Maybe is ‚ÄúI like the sound of this‚Äù. Projects/tasks stay within these
  lists until they become unwieldy. If a project has more than 10 tasks that I
  want to document I create a special list for it. To keep things organised I
  start these file names with an underscore (_) and then add a note below the
  task to see that file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Finally: Format. This took a while to nail down. As I mentioned I started in
  Drafts so as of when I recorded an episode of
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/episode-11-someday-maybe-never/&quot;
    &gt;Nested Folders 11: Someday/Maybe/Never&lt;/a
  &gt;
  I was still using &lt;code&gt;- [ ]&lt;/code&gt; to indicate a task. This does give you
  the look of pretty checkboxes - but the point of your Someday/Maybe list isn‚Äôt
  to keep of what you have &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;, but what you want &lt;em&gt;to do&lt;/em&gt;. This
  means I would never check the tasks off. Instead, I‚Äôve changed to just
  Taskpaper (at least the elements that OmniFocus uses) as this allows me to
  copy items over directly when I am ready to do so, and also to export easily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now I can update my someday/maybe list whenever I like, across devices, and
  see what I changed, and when. If you want to see a sample of this check out my

  &gt;

  In episode 37 of Automators David and I got our enchanted brooms ready and
  went to town on maintaining and managing your Mac. We did our best to get out
  all the cobwebs and find a way to automate all of this, while there may not be
  a robot vacuum for your Mac, there are plenty of tools you can use to make the
  magic happen automatically - good whether it‚Äôs your system or one you end up
  managing because the owner relies on you to do it!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  First up we tackled trash. I realised after the show that while we talked
  about how to use Hazel‚Äôs built in preference pane to manage the trash, I
  didn‚Äôt go into detail about how I do the more specific things that don‚Äôt show
  up there. The answer is (relatively) simple, I add the trash as a folder -
  this is easiest to do if you have something in the trash as you can drag that
  into the selector in Hazel. This lets me add all the usual Hazel rules, though
  I should also mention I‚Äôm doing it this way because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve done it
  for quite a while, rather than this being a good practice!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We also talked about Dropzone, there are a lot of actions available that you
  can just install in Dropzone, there‚Äôs an
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://aptonic.com/actions/&quot;&gt;official actions page&lt;/a&gt; and a further
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://atika.github.io/dropzone3-actions/&quot;&gt;action repository&lt;/a&gt;, I
  really need to look into deleting/moving files after I‚Äôve done specific
  actions, but these are a great way to automate nonetheless.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I hope you enjoy this episode of Automators, it was great fun to put together!

  McAllister about the systems and processes he has built over the years to

  Well, it turns out that with a lot of determination and research you can - and

  their productivity system around so we often don't know how they get things

A recent update to Shortcuts has added support for SSH keys when using the Run Script over SSH action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not allow you to import a key, only to generate them in a few formats (ed25519 and rsa). You can then copy the public key, and see the MD5 Hash as well as the SHA256 Hash.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-33/">&lt;p&gt;
  It's no secret that I love to travel - and I also love to be organized! Making
  a packing list is great fun, until you forget something so in this episode of
  Automators David and I decided to find as many ways as we could to solve the
  problem of creating a packing list. Naturally our techniques overlapped in a
  few places, but we still came up with a variety of solutions - which you can
  use to solve other problems too.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I've documented most of the Shortcuts in the show notes for this episode, but
  my Drafts action group (and accompanying Shortcut) need a little more space -
  so let's dive in!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  First of all, no matter how organised I might be I still need a task in my
  task management system to actually do the packing, so I kick off my process
  with a Shortcut, it looks through my calendar for all day events, I choose one
  of them, and then it creates a new Draft (tagged with &lt;code&gt;packing&lt;/code&gt;)
  before adding a task to OmniFocus with the title &quot;Pack&quot;, a due date of the
  start date of the trip, and a link to my Draft in the note. You can download
  the Shortcut here:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fdd67dbb01c14d749566441a07cfd1e9&quot;
    &gt;Create Packing List (Drafts &amp;amp; OF)&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now let's look at my Drafts action group, this has 8 actions (I've expanded a
  little since recording).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Manage Template List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  This gets you started with creating your basic lists if you don't have them
  yet - you choose categories (it suggests Clothes, Toiletries, and Technology),
  and then set the emoji for each category before adding items to it.&lt;br /&gt;
  If you already have a list you get 4 choices:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Add category - Asks you for the name of the category, an emoji to represent
    it, and items to add to it.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Update Emoji - Shows you all your categories and the emojis associated with
    them for editing.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delete Category - Gives you a choice of categories to delete.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Manage Category Items - Allows you to add or remove items in a category as
    well as correct spelling.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  None of these actions affect anything in any of your packing list - maybe
  someday I'll get to it, but not yet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    To find emoji quickly use &lt;a href=&quot;https://emojipedia.org/&quot;&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;,
    it has a great search and you can copy the emoji with just a tap.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Add a üîã emoji after anything that needs charging - I have a few actions to
    help you keep track of those.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tag Packing List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This just adds the tag &quot;packing&quot; to your Draft so you can filter for these
  quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Packing Items to List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This shows you a prompt with a list of your categories, you tap a category,
  deselect items within that category you do not wish to include (I assumed that
  you'll likely want all items in a category), and the items are added to your
  list. After this it runs the action &quot;Sort Packing Items&quot; automatically.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sort Packing Items&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You might be wondering why I'm bothering to assign emoji to my categories -
  aside from &quot;they're cute&quot;. It's simple: Emoji are sortable. So everything with
  a üëñ tag is grouped together. This way I can both visually identify items in a
  category, and the sort action (which is alphabetical) groups them together.
  All the items are in the task format in Drafts, this looks something like
  this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
- [ ] üëñ Jeans
- [x] üëñ TShirt
- [ ] üõÄ Shampoo
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Tapping on one of the &lt;code&gt;[ ]&lt;/code&gt; boxes checks it off (&lt;code&gt;[x]&lt;/code&gt;)
  or unchecks it. The &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is sorted below the space so unchecked items
  stay at the top.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncheck All&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I like to reuse my packing list on the way home to make sure I don't forget
  anything and that everything is charged, this unchecks everything, resets
  charging icons, and sorts the list again for me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I charge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Maybe I travel with too much tech, but I do travel with a lot and most of it
  needs charging - after all, what good is a battery pack that isn't charged?
  Everything that needs charging has a üîã icon at the end of it, this action
  grabs all of those items and shows them to me, selecting one replaces the
  battery with a üîå emoji, so I can see it is ready.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For items that you add outside of your list you may wish to add the battery
  emoji, instead of hunting though your keyboard for it use this action. It will
  also replace the battery with a plug or vice versa.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete Item&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just deletes the current row in Drafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  This all works with scripts in Drafts, I can't guarantee it will work
  perfectly so I would love to hear your feedback!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great camera on the iPhone means you can easily take good pictures, but by turning on the camera grid you can use the rule of thirds to take &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; pictures every time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has made health a commitment over the last few years. In the latest iOS and watchOS there are a whole host of features which you can use to keep on top of your health, including several things new in watchOS 6 and iOS 13. And on Tuesday, Apple announced a range of new health initiatives and studies to keep their focus dialled in for the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QR codes are everywhere nowadays, from rental bikes to trains, posters, and more. Once upon a time in iOS, you had to download and open an app to scan a QR code, but a few years ago Apple integrated it into the camera app to make life easier for all of us!&lt;/p&gt;

  routines. It was also good to review traps we've both previously fallen into
  with our reviews - I've been considering making a printed list of how I do my
  weekly review and if I do so I'm also going to make a list of &quot;not to do&quot; on
  it - as a reminder of those lessons that I've learned over the years!

	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/latest-shortcuts-beta-allows-you-to-get-links-to-shortcuts-with-shortcuts/">&lt;p&gt;Something I've been hoping for for a long time is the ability to get a (sharing) link to my Shortcuts with Shortcuts - and with the latest developer beta of iOS and iPadOS (beta 2) it can be done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4023&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/09/IMG_0149.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shortcuts actions&quot; width=&quot;1027&quot; height=&quot;1684&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully this is fairly simple to do, there are just 6 actions required to get a list of all your Shortcuts as Markdown links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get my shortcuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat with each item in &lt;code&gt;My Shortcuts&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get link to &lt;code&gt;Repeat Item&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text: [&lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt;][&lt;code&gt;Link to File&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine &lt;code&gt;Repeat Results&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;New Lines&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share &lt;code&gt;Combined Text&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one caveat to this: Unfortunately you need to confirm getting the link to each Shortcuts from a prompt which appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the Shortcut: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3b3a88788ca4499d81f7d786337d9b1c&quot;&gt;Get Shortcuts as Links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go and watch Netflix and tap the same prompt 900+ times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update! I've been experimenting and there's also a way to just tap &quot;Create Links&quot; once: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d998c0d0c9a64fefbef8a326f81a356d&quot;&gt;Get Markdown Links to Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; - you get the links first and then iterate through them grabbing the names of the associated Shortcuts. As long as the order of the Shortcuts remains constant this is a much more user friendly workaround.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-31-making-your-screenflow-flow-and-more-with-j-f-brissette</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-31-making-your-screenflow-flow-and-more-with-j-f-brissette/">&lt;p&gt;
  In this episode of Automators David and I got a chance to dive behind the
  scenes of ScreencastsOnline and into the Terminal app (not at the same time)
  with J.F. Brissette. David and J.F. met years ago at Macworld!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  J.F. does editing and assembly for ScreencastsOnline ‚Äî which means he spends a
  lot of time working with video and audio in ScreenFlow, and he has got his
  workflows down with automation. As he said ‚Äúit needs to be automated if you‚Äôre
  going to use it as much as I do‚Äù which is something worth bearing in mind for
  any application you use heavily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Keyboard Maestro is his tool of choice (as it is for many people), and he has
  many macros which he has found. The Clipboard History Switcher specifically
  makes it much easier to copy and paste elements around ‚Äî also allowing you to
  create a palette of elements from your macros, something that applies to many
  kinds of work!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  J.F. also uses Terminal a lot, for everything from opening apps to checking
  what day you were born on or what day your birthday will be on next!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;open -a Safari
open -a &quot;Keyboard Maestro&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  These open apps ‚Äî because Keyboard Maestro has a space in its name it needs to
  be wrapped in quotation marks. Note that capitalisation is optional, and you
  can use either single or double quotation marks ‚Äî J.F. tends to use lowercase
  and single quotations, like this: open -a 'keyboard maestro'.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cal 01 2021
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This will show you a calendar for January 2021 ‚Äì so you can quickly scan for
  ‚Äú11‚Äù and see that my birthday will be on a Monday!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We also had a look at regular expressions, which are a way to do search (and
  replace) with extra magic by defining very specific patterns. Shortcuts even
  supports regular expressions, both to &quot;Replace Text&quot; as well as with ‚ÄúMatch
  Text‚Äù, which can be followed by ‚ÄúGet Group from Matched Text.‚Äù

&lt;p&gt;For this show Myke, Stephen and Jason Snell devised a very special game of Family Feud - I'd never played before so of course I ended up being team captain (I'm not sure that was an entirely wise decision, but nonetheless it happened).&lt;/p&gt;

  In episode 30 of Automators David and I thought we'd share a few of our recent
  automations with you - as well as updating my TextExpander outputs to
  accommodate a switch in my email addresses I had some fun with Shortcuts!
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  When I was at
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/macstock-2019/&quot;&gt;MacStock&lt;/a&gt; not only did
  I have a great time but I spent some time making Shortcuts! Shortly after my
  deeper dive talk I got a chance to chat to an Automators fan, Bodie Quirk, who
  showed me his setup for playing entire albums from certain artists. Everything
  he had was working, but it was getting difficult to maintain (something that
  will probably happen to everyone at some point or another!). The challenge
  intrigued me, so I sat there for a while with an iOS 12 iPad and keyboard and
  poked at the problem. It took a few attempts (Bodie said he could see my brain
  working, what a compliment!), but I ended up with three Shortcuts which can do
  &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, and will do all the maintenance themselves!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  These Shortcuts are based on files saved in iCloud, you could save them in
  Dropbox if you prefer but they're only text files so won't take up much space.
  Shortcut #1 maintains our lists of artists - this file is used in Shortcut #2
  as well to help maintain the album lists.
&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Album Chooser Artists&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2895.jpeg&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-3716&quot;

      alt=&quot;&quot;
      width=&quot;350&quot;
      height=&quot;611&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Create Folder&lt;/code&gt; - this is necessary for the other steps to work,
    and once the folder has been created it will just continue on with life as
    normal.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Get File&lt;/code&gt; - this checks for the current artists file. It
    specifically doesn't throw an error if it's not found because then when you
    run the Shortcut for the first time (or if you've deleted the file for some
    reason) then you can create it with this step.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Get Text from Input&lt;/code&gt; - grabs the contents of our artists list if
    there is one
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; - here we put the content of the current artists list and
    &lt;code&gt;Ask When Run&lt;/code&gt;, the Text action with &lt;code&gt;Ask When Run&lt;/code&gt; is
    bigger than the ask for input button so its ideal here.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Save File&lt;/code&gt; - save our list of artists where the next Shortcut
    can grab them.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2

&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/88e31418b97c4dad8931ea6bb943767f&quot;
    &gt;Update Artist Albums&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2889.jpeg&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-3714&quot;

      alt=&quot;&quot;
      width=&quot;350&quot;
      height=&quot;1297&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  This Shortcut starts by setting a variable to nothing so that we have an empty
  list of albums. Then it grabs the lists of artists (maintained by the previous
  Shortcut, if it doesn't find it run the first Shortcut), and gives them to you
  as a list of artists to choose from. Then once you have chosen an artist it
  finds all the music where the artist is your chosen artist and gets the album
  name and if it doesn't have that album name in the list yet then it adds it.
  This is the part of the Shortcut that make take a long time to run if you have
  a prolific artist. Then it grabs the list of albums and saves them into a file
  with the name of the artist. If you want to be able to exclude albums then add
  a &lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt; action between
  &lt;code&gt;Get Variable: Albums&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Combine Text&lt;/code&gt; and make sure
  it's set to Allow Multiple (I'd also recommend checking all the albums by
  default).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2

  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac4ef17da46041dc8b9d36545a439153&quot;
    &gt;Play Album By Artist&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2892.jpeg&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img

      width=&quot;350&quot;
      height=&quot;652&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  This is the Shortcut which you would use most of the time - the one that lives
  in your widget and with a few taps will play the album of your choice. It
  starts by grabbing a list of all the album files from our last Shortcut, this
  way even if you added a new artist if you didn't run the Shortcut yet to get
  their albums you won't run into an error. After you've picked your artists it
  uses the contents of the file to show you a list of the albums by that artist,
  it grabs the music from that album sorted by track number and then plays it.
&lt;/p&gt;

  order!):

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/review-tom-bihn-synik/">&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: Tom Bihn provided this bag free for a review. All opinions below are entirely my own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may recall that recently I reviewed my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/review-waterfield-staad-backpack-slim/&quot;&gt;Waterfield Staad backpack&lt;/a&gt; which is a lovely backpack that I use a lot of the time. However there are times when I need to carry more than fits in this bag - trips where I'm away overnight or just need to carry a lot of things. When the chance came up to review a new Tom Bihn bag with a dedicated laptop compartment, clamshell opening and luggage pass through it seemed meant to be - and this was confirmed by the random number generator saying I won!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll start with some background. The Synik is based on another Tom Bihn bag, the Synapse. That one doesn't have a clamshell opening, dedicated laptop compartment, side opening, or luggage pass through - it's a great bag but honestly not one I would buy for myself. It comes in two sizes (19L and 25L), and according to everyone I know who has one it's an amazing bag. There are two sizes of the Synik, 22L and 30L, the idea was that enough space was added to the Synapse to make space for the dedicated laptop compartment and also to allow for full use of the clamshell opening. The straps on the Synik are also different - they're edgeless straps which means there are no seams touching your shoulders. Day to day I've not really noticed a massive benefit, but I'm sure if I loaded the bag up with heavy items that could cause the straps to dig in I would!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who aren't familiar with Tom Bihn bags there's some important facts you might like to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They're made in the USA in Seattle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of their bags have a variety of colour options available, including different internal colours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bags have O-rings, this allows you to clip things to your bag so you can pull them out without losing them or find them without digging around (my keys are on a long strap, my sunglasses are in a pouch which keeps them close to the top, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a wide array of accessories which you can purchase to go with your bag, including the above mentioned keystrap and sunglasses pouch (a small Ghost Whale for the curious).&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/08/IMG_2792-e1565102969741-768x1024.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3607&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tombihn.com/products/synik-22?mc_cid=b79d9019c9&amp;mc_eid=b23ea2e5f2&amp;variant=15334728073279&quot;&gt;22L&lt;/a&gt; to review, and was fortunate to get my preferred colour choice: Aubergine and Northwest Sky. The Aubergine is a thick rugged material, whereas the Northwest Sky is rather more flexble and great as an interior. There are choices for the outside material - I'd recommend checking the Tom Bihn site for the ins and outs of each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/08/IMG_2790-e1565102957398-225x300.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-3605&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bag has one main compartment, through which you can access the laptop compartment from the top. The laptop compartment can also be accessed from the outside, the outside zip isn't the full height of the laptop instead you push it in diagonally and then straighten the laptop up inside the pocket. It sounds complicated but in my experience many laptop pockets with external access work this way and it only takes one attempt to get the hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great bag for what I need, I used it at MacStock and aside from a few times when I forgot which pocket I'd put something in (I can do that even when I'm having an amazing day so don't blame the bag!) it worked perfectly. I put a Mac Mini inside in the box and carried it around (when S&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drdrang/status/1155506389428649984&quot;&gt;tephen Hackett sort of volunteered to upgrade the RAM in my Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; I couldn't say no!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several things I really love about this bag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The water bottle pocket is in the center, this means that I won't end up weighed down on one side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The front pockets pack inside the bag, instead of bulging outwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The front bottom pocket might look small but it fits my Nintendo Switch easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The clamshell opening means I can also just open the side of my bag and reach in to grab something (assuming I remember where I put it), and I can of course open up the whole bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not too large, I got away with it as my personal item flying home - the 30L would have looked large though and I might not have been so lucky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The laptop is suspended in the bag, so when you put it down it's not likely to hit the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a system where you can attach a &quot;cache&quot; (Tom Bihn's device sleeve) to the opposite side of the main pocket - I bought one for my 11&quot; iPad Pro and it's wonderful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can put it on the handle of my trolley case when in airport lounges, on airport buses, etc. (Did I mention I fly a lot?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one thing I've run into which I'm not a huge fan of: when the zippers are fully open you need use both hands to close the bag, pushing the chunky weatherproof zipper around that corner is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bag also comes with a removeable framesheet so you can make it lighter if you don't need as much structure. The framesheet is what suspends the laptop so I've only taken it out to try, it wasn't the easiest to get out but it's also not likely you'll be doing this on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this bag has only been on one adventure with me, but it will be coming to San Francisco later this month for a more extensive trial!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I don't have a Synapse to compare it to I borrowed some at MacStock for the comparison pictures below. This bag is sized exactly between the two models, but at a glance it looks more like the 19L - and that is what it is based on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm definitely very happy with this bag and can't wait to keep using it - now I need to plan more travel!&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">Disclaimer: Tom Bihn provided this bag free for a review. All opinions below are entirely my own. You may recall that recently I reviewed my Waterfield Staad backpack which is a lovely backpack that I use a lot of the time. However there are times when I need to carry more than fits in this bag - trips where I'm away overnight or just need to carry a lot of things. When the chance came up to review a new Tom Bihn bag with a dedicated laptop compartment, clamshell opening and luggage pass through it seemed meant to be - and this was confirmed by the random number generator saying I won! I'll start with some background. The Synik is based on another Tom Bihn bag, the Synapse. That one doesn't have a clamshell opening, dedicated laptop compartment, side opening, or luggage pass through - it's a great bag but honestly not one I would buy for myself. It comes in two sizes (19L and 25L), and according to everyone I know who has one it's an amazing bag. There are two sizes of the Synik, 22L and 30L, the idea was that enough space was added to the Synapse to make space for the dedicated laptop compartment and also to allow for full use of the clamshell opening. The straps on the Synik are also different - they're edgeless straps which means there are no seams touching your shoulders. Day to day I've not really noticed a massive benefit, but I'm sure if I loaded the bag up with heavy items that could cause the straps to dig in I would! For those of you who aren't familiar with Tom Bihn bags there's some important facts you might like to know: They're made in the USA in Seattle. All of their bags have a variety of colour options available, including different internal colours. Bags have O-rings, this allows you to clip things to your bag so you can pull them out without losing them or find them without digging around (my keys are on a long strap, my sunglasses are in a pouch which keeps them close to the top, etc.) There's a wide array of accessories which you can purchase to go with your bag, including the above mentioned keystrap and sunglasses pouch (a small Ghost Whale for the curious). I picked the 22L to review, and was fortunate to get my preferred colour choice: Aubergine and Northwest Sky. The Aubergine is a thick rugged material, whereas the Northwest Sky is rather more flexble and great as an interior. There are choices for the outside material - I'd recommend checking the Tom Bihn site for the ins and outs of each one. The bag has one main compartment, through which you can access the laptop compartment from the top. The laptop compartment can also be accessed from the outside, the outside zip isn't the full height of the laptop instead you push it in diagonally and then straighten the laptop up inside the pocket. It sounds complicated but in my experience many laptop pockets with external access work this way and it only takes one attempt to get the hang of it. This is a great bag for what I need, I used it at MacStock and aside from a few times when I forgot which pocket I'd put something in (I can do that even when I'm having an amazing day so don't blame the bag!) it worked perfectly. I put a Mac Mini inside in the box and carried it around (when Stephen Hackett sort of volunteered to upgrade the RAM in my Mac Mini I couldn't say no!). There are several things I really love about this bag: The water bottle pocket is in the center, this means that I won't end up weighed down on one side. The front pockets pack inside the bag, instead of bulging outwards. The front bottom pocket might look small but it fits my Nintendo Switch easily. The clamshell opening means I can also just open the side of my bag and reach in to grab something (assuming I remember where I put it), and I can of course open up the whole bag. It's not too large, I got away with it as my personal item flying home - the 30L would have looked large though and I might not have been so lucky. The laptop is suspended in the bag, so when you put it down it's not likely to hit the floor. There's a system where you can attach a &quot;cache&quot; (Tom Bihn's device sleeve) to the opposite side of the main pocket - I bought one for my 11&quot; iPad Pro and it's wonderful. I can put it on the handle of my trolley case when in airport lounges, on airport buses, etc. (Did I mention I fly a lot?) There is one thing I've run into which I'm not a huge fan of: when the zippers are fully open you need use both hands to close the bag, pushing the chunky weatherproof zipper around that corner is hard. The bag also comes with a removeable framesheet so you can make it lighter if you don't need as much structure. The framesheet is what suspends the laptop so I've only taken it out to try, it wasn't the easiest to get out but it's also not likely you'll be doing this on a regular basis. So far this bag has only been on one adventure with me, but it will be coming to San Francisco later this month for a more extensive trial! As I don't have a Synapse to compare it to I borrowed some at MacStock for the comparison pictures below. This bag is sized exactly between the two models, but at a glance it looks more like the 19L - and that is what it is based on! I'm definitely very happy with this bag and can't wait to keep using it - now I need to plan more travel!

  In episode 29 of Automators we got to talk to Adam Tow - creator of awesome
  automations. I met Adam at the Automators WWDC meet up this year and he demoed
  some of his wonderful shortcuts for me. I've seen them before and even tried
  them out, but once I saw Adam demoing them David and I knew we had to get him
  on the show to share how this all works!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam walked us through a few of his amazing automations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://msgfiler.com/&quot;&gt;MsgFiler&lt;/a&gt;: A way to file messages in Mail
    extremely quickly. I've been trying this since we recorded and I'm sold,
    I'll admit I love using the keyboard and tend not to reach for the mouse
    unless I have to but this is a great utility!
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://tow.com/2016/12/31/wireless-photography-canon-5d4/&quot;
      &gt;Photo Magic&lt;/a
    &gt;: Adam has an amazing setup whereby photos taken on his DSLR end up
    automatically sent to him via iMessage, added to Photos, uploaded to Google
    Photos, oh, and the RAW photos are uploaded to Amazon too. Sounds crazy?
    There's a bunch of &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good reasons for this!
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3262&quot;
      &gt;The Dark Dungeon Text Adventure&lt;/a
    &gt;: Did you know you can play a text adventure game in Shortcuts? Or have it
    translated into (almost) any language? Adam made it easy!
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details you'll have to listen to the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As a note, in the show I said I thought you could get a public link to a
  Dropbox folder through Shortcuts. You can get links to files, but for some
  reason links to folders no longer works - this is a shame, but we can hope
  that Dropbox offer this as a parameterised Shortcut in iOS 13.

  In this latest episode of Nested Folders I introduced Scotty to the idea of
  the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay&quot;&gt;Non Zero Day&lt;/a&gt;. I stumbled
  across this a few years ago on Reddit and thought that it was a great idea,
  &lt;em&gt;do something towards your goals every day&lt;/em&gt;. It might not seem like
  rocket surgery but saying it out loud and then reviewing your efforts can make
  a big difference - especially for those larger goals!

  Today I‚Äôm launching a new podcast called Nested Folders with a friend of mine
  &lt;a href=&quot;heyscottyj.com&quot;&gt;Scotty Jackson&lt;/a&gt;. Scotty and I met when we started
  testing early versions of OmniFocus 3 together, I believe our first real
  encounter was me helping him replicate a bug report so he could nail down the
  steps to email in. (Coincidentally this is also where I met
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://nostodnayr.net/&quot;&gt;Ryan Dotson&lt;/a&gt; who I ended up writing
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://omnifocusbook.com&quot;&gt;Build Your OmniFocus Workflow&lt;/a&gt; with -
  who would have guessed that people eager to do an early beta test of OmniFocus
  would also be good people to make productivity related content with?!)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Nested Folders is a productivity themed podcast, Scotty and I will be diving
  into all sorts of topics from project planning, to weekly reviews, when not to
  be productive and more. The
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/episode-0-introductions/&quot;
    &gt;Introduction Episode (0)&lt;/a
  &gt;
  and
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/episode-1-checklisting-a-project/&quot;
    &gt;Episode 1: Checklisting a Project&lt;/a
  &gt;
  are out today! Episodes will come out every 2 weeks on Tuesdays.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I hope you‚Äôll download the first episodes, give us a listen and subscribe. All
  of the details are over on the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://nestedfolderspodcast.com&quot;&gt;Nested Folders&lt;/a&gt; website, and the
  podcast also has it‚Äôs own Twitter account
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NestedFolders&quot;&gt;@NestedFolders&lt;/a&gt; which because I
  am an automation geek automatically feeds into our spreadsheet for feedback.

  In Automators 27 David and I did the thing we do best: ignore all the advice,
  install the betas, suffer for it, but in the end we got you the goods on
  Shortcuts in iOS 13 and what it's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  One of the things we love in this new version of Shortcuts is the replacement
  of &lt;code&gt;Get Variable&lt;/code&gt; with this new sentence format in each action.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  [caption id=&quot;attachment_3325&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;624&quot;]&lt;img

  /&gt;
  Shortcut on iOS 12: Get calendar event, choose from list, get start time, get
  chosen event, get end time[/caption]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  [caption id=&quot;attachment_3326&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;685&quot;]&lt;img
    class=&quot;wp-image-3326 size-large&quot;
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/07/IMG_D66C9D68C283-1-685x1024.jpeg&quot;
    alt=&quot;iOS 13 version of the same shortcut&quot;
    width=&quot;685&quot;
    height=&quot;1024&quot;
  /&gt;
  iOS 13 version of the same shortcut[/caption]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I know in the episode I said I would do a video on this, but I think these
  screenshots explain it much better than a video would have! It's now much
  easier to see what you're working with - and that's better for everyone from
  Shortcuts super nerds to people just poking around who find it installed on
  their devices after they update the OS in September.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I hope you enjoy listening to the episode - David and I are both running
  developer beta 3 now!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/automators/27&quot;
    &gt;Episode 27: Shortcuts in iOS 13 - Diving into the Deep End!&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One note: I said in the episode that I wasn't able to run Shortcuts from
  notifications (e.g. with triggers like time) - beta 3 resolved this.
&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/discourse-forums-i-visit/">&lt;p&gt;There are lots of wonderful communities out there on the internet, and I‚Äôm fortunate enough to be a part of some of them! I‚Äôve seen several people recently asking for recommendations of forums to visit and thought I‚Äôd put together a list of the ones I visit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.automators.fm&quot;&gt;Automators&lt;/a&gt; - Yes, the podcast I host with David Sparks has its own forum! There are lots of wonderful people who hang out there sharing automation goodness, and we also host the Scriptable forum inside it too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.macpowerusers.com&quot;&gt;Mac Power Users&lt;/a&gt; - A great podcast, and another forum of awesome people (just like all the others on this list). From tech support to Star Wars there‚Äôs plenty to talk about - and the forum for Focused is here too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://club.bookworm.fm&quot;&gt;Bookworm&lt;/a&gt; - Another excellent podcast, I love looking through this forum for book recommendations (and summaries of the key points people got from them).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.productivityguild.com&quot;&gt;The Productivity Guild&lt;/a&gt; - This is a great place to talk about the productivity things many of us love and often struggle with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.getdrafts.com&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt; - I‚Äôm constantly stealing script ideas from people here to use in my own Drafts installs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.omnigroup.com&quot;&gt;OmniGroup&lt;/a&gt; - I confess to primarily being in the OmniFocus area of this forum, and it‚Äôs always interesting to see how other people are using this task management software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.devontechnologies.com&quot;&gt;DevonTechnologies&lt;/a&gt; - DevonThink can be used in so many ways that every time I open the forum I come up with new ideas to make even more out of the software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.airtable.com&quot;&gt;AirTable&lt;/a&gt; - I‚Äôm still learning how to use AirTable to the max and this place has lots of suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://agenda.community&quot;&gt;Agenda&lt;/a&gt; - I use Agenda for my notes at work and it‚Äôs great seeing how other users set it up for themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, some of you may be thinking of Discord - a chat system, Discourse is forum hosting software - they have similar names and both can host communities but that‚Äôs where the similarities end!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  automation setups and went beyond &quot;I can control it from my phone&quot; to find out
  what things you can really &lt;em&gt;automate&lt;/em&gt;, because that's the kind of
  automation nerds we are!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I have personally been using
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id995994352?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;Home 3&lt;/a&gt; a
  lot to amp up my automations - this is what lets me specify the night time
  routine should only run if the kitchen light is on, and more. These things
  aren't available in the Home app that comes baked into your iPhone, but this
  app makes them available and doesn't require you to run anything else on a
  server somewhere to make it all work.
&lt;/p&gt;

  In the latest episode of Automators David and I went crazy over AirTable - we
  use it to plan Automators which makes our life so much easier, that combined
  with the automations you can attach to this meant it was the perfect topic for
  an episode of Automators!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  As well as AirTable we touched on David's
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.macsparky.com/p/km?affcode=256645_0ohxw3fs&quot;
    &gt;Keyboard Maestro Field Guide&lt;/a
  &gt;
  - he's put together over 4 hours of video content and I've been learning a lot
  from it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also produced two screencasts for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  Automators 24: Blog Post Editorial Calendar in AirTable with Shortcuts&lt;br /&gt;
  https://youtu.be/-4HSATi6abU
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I also have a bonus tip for you which I stole from
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.matthewcassinelli.com&quot;&gt;Matthew Casinelli&lt;/a&gt;, if you
  modify a dictionary that you get from AirTable in Shortcuts, switch your
  &lt;code&gt;Get Content of URL&lt;/code&gt; action to POST a file - and then use a magic
  variable to grab the dictionary you need to send to AirTable. Magic!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    alt=&quot;&quot;
    width=&quot;150&quot;
    height=&quot;150&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  David Sparks and I teased it on Automators back in
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://relay.fm/automators/17&quot;&gt;episode 17&lt;/a&gt;, and now the app is
  here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://timeryapp.com&quot;&gt;Timery&lt;/a&gt;, the Toggl app we all wish
  Toggl had made! the
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  What‚Äôs impressive about this app, is that I rarely launch it, but I‚Äôm pretty
  sure my workflow would feel broken without it. Timery has excellent
  integrations with Shortcuts, letting me start and stop timers as part of my
  automations without thinking. Whenever I run Shortcuts to put myself into
  certain modes (such as podcasting, or writing for my blog), as well as
  launching the correct applications, I also start logging my time. I also build
  in checks to let me know how long I‚Äôve already worked on projects today when I
  end my timers - this is a not so gentle nudge that if I want to achieve my
  goals, I should invest an appropriate amount of time in them!&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;aligncenter&quot;
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_1858.png&quot;
    alt=&quot;Saved timers&quot;
    width=&quot;270&quot;
    height=&quot;536&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  The main screen in Timers is your saved timers which serve three purposes,
  letting you start tracking a project, with tags and a description if you so
  choose, with just a tap. These timers are also donated to Siri (and therefore
  Shortcuts), and also display how long you‚Äôve worked on those timers today. I
  find this screen great for both a quick overview as well as starting timers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;aligncenter&quot;
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_1856.png&quot;
    alt=&quot;Creating a project in Timery&quot;
    width=&quot;270&quot;
    height=&quot;536&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next screen is Time Entries where you can see log of your most recent time
  entries. There are swipe options for these entries allowing you to delete or
  edit them, as well as play button which lets you start a new time tracking
  entry with the same parameters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    width=&quot;270&quot;
    height=&quot;536&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The developer behind Timery, &lt;a href=&quot;joehribar.com&quot;&gt;Joe Hribar&lt;/a&gt;, has
  worked extremely hard to make sure this app rivals the Toggl app - it has all
  the core functionality covered, as well as genuinely excellent shortcuts
  support. This means there‚Äôs full support for Workspaces, the premium Toggl
  feature which lets you helps you carve up your life further with tags and
  projects belonging to Workspaces.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;aligncenter&quot;
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/timery_shortcuts_support.png&quot;
    alt=&quot;Timerys Shortcuts&quot;
    width=&quot;795&quot;
    height=&quot;527&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  The way I use Timery most, is through Shortcuts. I use Launch Center Pro and
  Pushcuts to send me notifications which I use to launch Shortcuts, and these
  shortcuts tell Timery to track my time for me. As all the saved timers can be
  used to both start timers as well as check the time logged so far on each of
  them this alone becomes helpful for tracking time. The Shortcuts support
  allows you to toggle ‚Äúshow when run‚Äù (this is the only setting on all donated
  shortcuts within the Shortcuts app right now) - this is used to show you the
  details of your time tracking, and it‚Äôs done in a minimalist way which makes
  sure I see the information I need and can dismiss the notification within a
  second or two at most.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As well as the saved timers in the app, you can also just start time tracking
  and add the details you want or need - which makes it easy to get going and
  then you can give it a title, project, or tags later before you finish (or
  after the fact with the Timery club).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;timeryclub&quot;&gt;Timery Club&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The Timery app in its free state is excellent, but if you join the Timery
  Club, an optional in app subscription of $9.99/year, as well as supporting
  development of the app you get extra functionality:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Unlimited saved timers, the free version allows you to have 4 saved timers
    (which in my opinion is a generous number).
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Edit all the elements of time entries from the last week as well as delete
    and duplicate them.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add historical time entries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add, edit, and delete Toggl projects, tasks, and tags.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Show your tag names in the saved timers (otherwise the tag icon is
    displayed)
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Custom themes, app icons, and dark mode. Dark mode can be toggled based on
    the screen brightness, sunrise, and sunset, or manually.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  If you have no interest in tracking your time then this app is not for you,
  but if you‚Äôre curious about it, or have been struggling with it - or even if
  you already track every second and want to make your life easier, I highly
  recommend downloading Timery. It has made it much easier for me to track my
  time, because it is very simple to use - and in my case, it builds right into
  my shortcuts that I already use to launch a significant number of actions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Timery feels like a much better-designed app than the Toggl app, there‚Äôs more
  data on the screen, and I can choose what data goes on what screen - as well
  as the Shortcuts that should be donated (instead of doing the action and
  letting it show up and then having lots of unnecessary actions in my Shortcuts
  app. Plus the developer is active and open to feedback and suggestions for
  improvement!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Timery is available on the App Store today, it‚Äôs a free download with an
  optional in app purchase for the Timery Club which is $0.99/month or
  $9.99/year.

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/review-waterfield-staad-backpack-slim/">&lt;p&gt;When I was in Chicago for &lt;a href=&quot;https://relay.fm/mpu/472&quot;&gt;MPU Live&lt;/a&gt; in March I took the opportunity to order a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfbags.com/collections/laptop-backpacks/products/staad-laptop-backpack&quot;&gt;Waterfield Staad backpack&lt;/a&gt; to my hotel to bring back with me. I'd been intrigued by their bags for quite some time, but after seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://welltempered.net&quot;&gt;MacGenie&lt;/a&gt; with one of these at PodCon, and seeing MacSparky's Sling bag at the same event, I was convinced I wanted the bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_0045.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with logistics: I realised only shortly before my trip that this would be a great time to get the bag, so I paid for premium shipping, contacted Gary through the contact address on their web page, and hoped for the best - and they delivered (with time to spare)! After collecting it from the Fedex in my hotel (still cheaper than international shipping I would note), I actually got my hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked the black ballistic with the chocolate leather, I'm a fan of the Indiana Jones look - but I like my bags to look pristine for as long as possible and knew the ballistic fabric would deliver that, however leather ages whatever you do - so the chocolate was an obvious choice to let me still see the wear on it! The inside of the flap is lined with smooth black leather, and this doesn't mark easily so I suspect the completely black model wouldn't have either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some background: I fly, a lot. I'm writing this review on my 5th flight this month, which happens to be my 3rd weekend on the road (or in the air) in a row. Next weekend I'm not going anywhere (at least that I know of), and then I'm off to WWDC which involves 4 flights. I fly carry on only whenever I can, because it's cheaper, and it means I know my things will be with me when I land. However this means my backpack is restricted to some pretty small dimensions - unless I wanted to put everything in my backpack (which if you've queued in the immigration line at LAX before you will probably agree is not fun). So I need a small backpack, I also want to be able to get at everything pretty easily - without said items falling out of the bag if I open it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bag is perfect for me as it has a laptop sleeve which fits my 13&quot; MacBook Air like it was made for it (it's actually made for the 13&quot; MacBook Pro which is cuboid rather than wedge shaped), and another sleeve on the front of that for my 11&quot; iPad Pro in the smart folio with the Apple Pencil. On the inside of the bag at the top there are two vertical pockets which close with Velcro - I use one for my passport and one for my charger and USB C cables (to USB C and Lightning). On the front at the bottom you have two pockets as well - these are designed so that if you swing the bag up under your arm they face up (or completely down if you open the opposite side pocket), which is where my purse (American: wallet), AirPods, any medication I need, lip balm, tissues, etc., live. If I'm taking the bag to work my work ID/access card go in there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_1846.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else goes in the main compartment in front of my iPad Pro - this usually includes things like my Bose headphones in their case (I prefer to fly with the QC35s, but sometimes take the QC30s instead), Nintendo Switch, etc. Overfilling the bag isn't an option because then the flap wouldn't close - but this helps me limit what I'm carrying and I appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was impressed with this bag when I first got it in March, but 2 months later I can see it's truly holding up as it ought to - it looks great, and it works. Because of the sleeves for my devices (which aren't insanely large as they often are in bags) I can just slip my laptop and iPad in and out, the half zip on the front under the flap lets me get access to things inside if I need to, but keeps things securely in place. The clasp is very good too - it closes easily (unless you try to overstuff the bag), and it stays put. The fabric is also exactly wide enough that you can slip a pin on it for decoration without worrying about damage or impaired function. The bag also fits nicely on my frame - the Stout model is unsurprisingly larger, which is one reason why I didn't order it (if I have space in a bag I will absolutely throw things in &quot;just in case&quot; and then end up regretting lugging said items around later) - and I'm 5'7&quot; as well as pretty slim. I'm also really pleased with the padding on the straps and the back of the bag (pictured below), they're thick and comfortable, but not so thick that the bad becomes bulky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_1845.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that remains to be seen is if the iPad pocket will fit my iPad Pro with the Brydge keyboard attached - however that is something I'll have to wait another week or so to try! I'm very pleased with my bag - and now I have to admit I'm very tempted to try out some of their other products like one of their cases for the Nintendo Switch!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

These shortcuts include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak Brush Teeth Routine&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Special Day Countdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do Not Disturb timer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 13 of these shortcuts in total, and it just goes to show how technology can be helpful for everyone, but in some cases it can make a massive difference.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/pushcut-smart-notifications-kick-off-your-shortcuts/">&lt;p&gt;
  As I've talked about on Automators before, I have used Zapier to send
  notifications to my iPhone which trigger Shortcuts - this means that I can
  have a series of automated actions happen and follow it up with something I
  need to manually do. I've been using PushBullet and Pushover to do this - I've
  tried both and they're both good, but they're designed for notifications and
  the URLs triggering automations is not something it was designed to do.
  Additionally PushBullet still hasn't been updated for the iPhone X(s) screen
  format. Pushover has been updated more recently, but it still doesn't quite
  match up with what Pushcut can do as a dedicated app.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by looking at a few use cases for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    MacSparky and I take it in turns to post the Automators episodes, that means
    every second episode when it releases I need to be prompted to put up my
    blog post about the episode. That post is prepared, and is in Drafts, so
    once the episode is up I get a notification that triggers a Shortcut to help
    me find the right Draft and post it.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    When an article of mine goes up on The Sweet Setup I like to go and clean it
    out of my Dropbox (where the drafts sit), which I do through a Shortcut, and
    then post about it on my site.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Those are just two of the many use cases I have for this sort of thing, in
  each case there can be multiple steps I would like to execute on my device -
  some of these I've combined into a single Shortcut which runs those other
  shortcuts, but others I'm still trying to rely on my memory (which has more
  holes in it than a sieve!). Also if I want or need to change these I need to
  log into Zapier and change the URL scheme that's in the URL part of the
  notification action step (whether that's through Pushover or Pushbullet).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Pushcut is a free app with two subscription levels, I'll give you a quick
  overview of those:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Free&lt;/strong&gt;: Create three notifications, which can each trigger
    one action (opening a URL or running a Shortcut).
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Basic&lt;/strong&gt;: Create as many notifications as you want, with as
    many actions as you want on each notification. Plus you can sync these
    between your devices.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Pro&lt;/strong&gt;: Dynamic notifications - based on JSON you use to
    trigger the notification which can give you: inputs for Shortcuts and
    dynamic title and text in notifications. You can also target individual
    devices.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I immediately decided I wanted the Pro - I've been passing variables to
  Shortcuts as parameters through Zapier, and I've been building my own
  workarounds for branching to give me different information. Most people should
  start out with the free level and then try basic though to get to grips with
  the system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_1709.png&quot;
    class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2661&quot;
    alt=&quot;&quot;
    width=&quot;320&quot;
    height=&quot;636&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The first thing to do is to create a notification in the Pushcut app, and give
  it a name. The name of the in the app is separate to what appears as the title
  of the notification which is very useful allowing you to have useful internal
  descriptions, but have an action based title. The title gets URL encoded and
  becomes part of the URL you POST to in order to trigger the notification.
  Tapping this URL will copy it to your clipboard - and I'll come back to what
  to do with that near the end!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_1710.png&quot;
    class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2662&quot;
    alt=&quot;&quot;
    width=&quot;320&quot;
    height=&quot;636&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Secondly you want to set the Notification Title and Description. These are
  what will show up on your device when you get the notification, I like mine to
  tell me what to do, and why I'm doing it - this way I won't just ignore the
  notifications because the seem irrelevant. After this you should set a default
  action, and you probably want to add this as action as well. The default
  action is what happens if you just tap on the notification, or swipe on it
  from the lock screen, and the actions are what you (can) trigger after force
  touching the notification - you can add multiple actions to a notification
  here, giving you a choice in which action to execute.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_1711.png&quot;
    class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2663&quot;
    alt=&quot;&quot;
    width=&quot;320&quot;
    height=&quot;636&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now we have the basics set up we can trigger the notification! Depending on
  your needs you could use this with something like IFTTT or Zapier's web hooks,
  or even build it into a script somewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_1713.png&quot;
    class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2665&quot;
    alt=&quot;&quot;
    width=&quot;320&quot;
    height=&quot;636&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now whenever this is triggered you will get a notification sent to your device
  which when opened will trigger a Shortcut.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_1714.png&quot;
      class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2664&quot;
      alt=&quot;&quot;
      width=&quot;320&quot;
      height=&quot;636&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In addition to what I've outlined above you can enhance this with the Pro
  options - allowing you to specify custom notification titles and content, and
  also pass input to your shortcuts. You can also run URL schemes allowing you
  to something like add a task to Due - without having to go via Shortcuts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I've been fortunate enough to talk to the developer of Pushcut over the last
  few weeks and he's been adding enhancements right and left! While the app and
  service are already a step up from existing solutions just because of the ease
  of use, the fact that this is a dedicated service for triggering automations
  on iOS means it really is well thought out.
&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-23-diving-into-drafts-automation-with-tim-the-drafts-man-nahumck/">&lt;p&gt;
  I was really excited when &lt;a href=&quot;https://nahmuck.me/&quot;&gt;Tim Nahumck&lt;/a&gt; agreed
  to come onto Automators to talk about
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://getdrafts.com&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt;! In the last year the app has
  increased in power so much, as well as gaining a Mac app, and now seemed like
  the perfect time to cover it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Today I thought I'd share a few bonus tips that were mentioned in the episode
  but not completely covered, starting with the Apple Watch component.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABaMAAAszCAYAAACIWkB7AAABgmlDQ1BzUkdCIElFQzYxOTY2LTIu-2.png&quot;
    class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2584&quot;
    alt=&quot;Drafts Settings for Apple Watch on iPhone&quot;
    width=&quot;406&quot;
    height=&quot;806&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In Drafts on the iPhone paired to your Apple Watch you can control some bonus
  settings. First of all you can enable auto-capture - this means when you open
  Drafts on your Apple Watch (such as from a complication) it will start
  listening for dictation - so you just open the app and start talking. You can
  also enable showing the inbox count, which is the number of Drafts in your
  inbox. The final extra setting is giving everything from your Apple Watch a
  default tag - mine is called Apple Watch (iOS and macOS automatically
  capitalise it, but drafts only uses lowercase tags to help you avoid
  duplicates). As I mentioned on the show, automatically tagging everything from
  your watch can be a useful indicator that your Draft might not be 100% what
  you said, but rather what the dictation engine &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; you said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAjoAAAPoCAYAAADXyVRQAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAJ-2.png&quot;
    class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2585&quot;
    alt=&quot;&quot;
    width=&quot;361&quot;
    height=&quot;634&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Something I realised not too long ago was that you can associate action groups
  with workspaces. A workspace is a saved filter of tags and/or a search term,
  and an action group is a group of actions - the one above the keyboard row,
  and the one in the pop out menu (which can be pinned open on larger devices)
  on the right hand side. In the bottom of the settings for the Workspace you
  can specify which action groups should be assigned to the keyboard row and the
  action pop out - so when you switch workspaces the rest of the app can switch
  too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/05/IMG_1621.png&quot;

    width=&quot;382&quot;
    height=&quot;1749&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Drafts is a very powerful app - so much so that it's replaced many other apps
  for me, I hope you enjoy the episode!

	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/mindnode-6-release</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/mindnode-6-release/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/04/MindNode-AppIcon-macOS.png&quot; alt=&quot;MindNode icon&quot; width=&quot;153&quot; height=&quot;153&quot; /&gt; MindNode 6 is out today, and having been a part of the beta I thought it was high time I shared some of the many ways I use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of things for me start as vague ideas, this often happens in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/how-i-use-drafts-on-iphone-macos-and-apple-watch/&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt;, but for multi faceted ideas that need exploration - like this blog post, I then move things over to MindNode - specifically I do this using an action which makes use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindnode.com/support/userguides/ios/automation&quot;&gt;MindNode's URL schemes&lt;/a&gt; - you can get the action &lt;a href=&quot;https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1WJ&quot;&gt;from the Drafts Action Directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/04/Focus-Mode.png&quot; alt=&quot;Focus Mode in MindNode on the Mac&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a lot of things at work recently that involve hierarchies - one thing branching into more, which in turn branch into more. I've been showing this as we progress throughout a meeting with MindNode, so we start the meeting with the centre point, or main node, and progress from there. This means as people are discussing ideas I can reflect it visually on the whiteboard, and I have a pretty graphic to send them afterwards! The enhanced presentation mode in MindNode 6 has been very helpful for this, letting me show off notes that I've made on areas, or even to lock the view while I zoom in on something else and tweak a spelling mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few features of MindNode 6 have been game changers though - first of all, multi select. You can do this with a finger or an Apple Pencil - and it's exactly what it sounds like, letting you select multiple nodes. You can then move them all, copy them, or do whatever you want or need to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/04/Stickers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Searching for stickers in MindNode&quot; width=&quot;1011&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also love how you can search for stickers, the team was smart and assigned multiple keywords to each sticker - so searching for &quot;sign&quot; gets me, among other things, the warning sign - as does searching for &quot;warning&quot;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/04/Outline-with-Tasks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Outline Mode&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; height=&quot;652&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way I use MindNode is to give me a good overview of projects, the folding and unfolding of nodes comes in handy here, allowing me to zoom in and out as needed. Add to this the new ability to hide connections and I have a great way of looking at everything, or just the key areas - helped by the focus feature which lets me fade out everything else. I love the ability to switch to outline view too - while I tend to prefer visuals, sometimes you just need a list - like when you've planned out a packing list! Being able to switch to the outline view also shows me things from a new perspective - which often helps me to fill in gaps in my plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to describe use cases for MindNode unless you've previously used a mind mapping application - but when you need to structure keywords, and text it's a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mindnode.com/news/2019-04-24-mindnode-6-has-arrived&quot;&gt;MindNode 6&lt;/a&gt; is out now and is a free upgrade for all MindNode 5 users. The Mac app is also part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.setapp.com/invite/rosemaryjayneorchard&quot;&gt;Setapp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/calzones-release/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-thumbnail wp-image-2379 alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/04/CalZones-150x150.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;A lot of things in my life involve working around time zones - David Sparks lives in California, so when organising a time to podcast with him that's a 9 hour difference, add a podcast guest and unless they're in the same time as one of us, you have a headache!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time I've used &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/klok-time-zone-converter/id965118917?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&quot;&gt;Klok&lt;/a&gt; as my go-to widget for checking what time it is somewhere, and recently I added &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/time-there-imessage-edition/id1308568825?mt=8&amp;uo=4&quot;&gt;Time There&lt;/a&gt;, an iMessage app, to help me find future times for appointments, meetings, and everything else. This wasn't a great system though, Time There is really for planning things in the next few days so going beyond that involves a lot of scrolling, and Klok means you need to calculate everything yourself. I use Fantastical as my calendar and that has timezone support too - so you can add an event at 8am San Francisco time and it shows up at 5pm Vienna time, but this works &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you've planned the event, still leaving you with the task of figuring out the when which is the most difficult part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calzones/id1451728473?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&quot;&gt;CalZones&lt;/a&gt; - by David Smith, maker of &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sleep/id1038440371?mt=8&quot;&gt;Sleep++&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/workouts/id1182551958?mt=8&quot;&gt;Workouts++&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/activity/id1089666978?mt=8&quot;&gt;Activity++&lt;/a&gt;. He is familiar with the problem I and many others face - and decided to make the app for us! CalZones starts by giving me a month overview of my calendar, I tend not to have too many appointments in one day, and the coloured dots below each date indicate how many events I have and which calendar they are on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the app settings, you can configure your timezones and for each time zone, you can give it a custom name and an abbreviation. This means that I can call SoCal time &quot;David&quot;, but central time &quot;Stephen&quot; so I can skip that mental overhead of remembering who is in which timezone. These timezones then show up as a vertical scroller when creating and editing events, letting me see the time selected for all of my favourite timezones. These timezones also show up in the widget, with your preferred names, giving you a quick reference as to what time it is where - or in my case, for whom! The expanded widget shows you these in a linear fashion, and tapping on a time in the future jumps you straight to the event creation page for that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with specifying your time zones you can also control which calendars you see, your preferred theme and icon, work day times, week start, and how event times should be displayed. The latter is very useful allowing you to see that the event you're looking at starts at 7pm local time, but 10am in the organisers time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daily calendar view is where your chosen colour theme comes into play. It highlights working hours (set in your preferences), then non-working hours before midnight, and then the hours after midnight until the working day starts - in three colours. This lets you see how hospitable the time is to your fellow participants, and helps you avoid scheduling something at 3am instead of 3pm by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the few weeks I've been using this app it's been indispensable - and it earned a spot on my home screen within just a few hours. For people who never deal with timezones, this app might not be for you, but it's a solid app and those of us who need something like this are very grateful for its existence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calzones/id1451728473?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&quot;&gt;CalZones&lt;/a&gt; is available on the App Store today for $4.99.&lt;/p&gt;

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-21-dr-drang/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automators 21: Invoicing, Writing, and Regular Expressions with Dr. Drang" />

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-21-dr-drang/">&lt;p&gt;
  In episode 21 of Automators, David and I were joined by the lovely Dr Drang!
  You may have heard him on a few other podcasts, including Mac Power Users.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  We dug into getting started with HyperCard and HyperTalk - back when those
  were available, these were created by Bill Atkinson - and there's a
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.txt&quot;
    &gt;story about him having to submit the number of lines of code he wrote&lt;/a
  &gt;
  when he was working on QuickDraw that made me smile!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Nowadays Dr Drang mostly using Python to program his automations - with a dose
  of AppleScript and Keyboard Maestro to get certain information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Regular Expressions are something we talked about in depth, they're hard to
  explain - let alone on a podcast, but as David said - they're essentially a
  special language for searching. One thing I forgot to say on the podcast was
  that regular expressions can and do vary between languages - but the basic
  rules stay the same which makes things easier! If you want to get started with
  Regular Expressions then &lt;a href=&quot;https://regex101.com/&quot;&gt;Regex 101&lt;/a&gt; is a
  pretty good place to get started - you can input plenty of sample text and it
  highlights what you've matched as you go, as well as explaining your
  expressions and having the quick expressions area in the bottom right-hand
  corner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Another thing we talked about are things you don't necessarily want to
  complete to automate - such as sending invoice emails or creating the harsher
  reminder email to pay an overdue invoice. This is something well worth keeping
  in mind when creating automations - even if you can automate it the whole way
  through, it's good to have some human intervention in some areas. And in some
  places, you can't automate things - such as adding a repeat to a reminder, so
  you need to step in and do something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Local weather is something lots of people want! And while Weather Underground
  has shut down you can still use Dark Sky's API if you want to program your own
  solution, and for an &quot;out of the box&quot; solution you could use Netatmo and
  Carrot weather - I do both of these!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Drafts is one of my favourite applications ever and it was great to hear Drang
  break down his blogging workflow and how it makes use of the great automation
  features available to us in the app. The
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://actions.getdrafts.com/&quot;&gt;Drafts Action Directory&lt;/a&gt; is an
  excellent resource and all of the actions there can be installed whether or
  not you're a pro user of the app.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/04/IMG_1299-151x300.jpeg&quot;
    class=&quot;aligncenter&quot;
    alt=&quot;Handling missing input in Shortcuts&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One tip I talked about in regards to Shortcuts is checking if input is present
  - and I have a fairly standard setup I use to handle this:&lt;br /&gt;
  * Count Items&lt;br /&gt;
  * If equals zero&lt;br /&gt;
  * Get photos/files - depending on what you want&lt;br /&gt;
  * Else: get the input provided to the shortcut.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This means that when I run my shortcuts from the widget screen, Drafts, Launch
  Center Pro, or directly within Shortcuts, I don't get confused when it doesn't
  work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It was excellent to have Dr. Drang on the show, and I hope you enjoy the
  episode!
&lt;/p&gt;

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/anker-lightning-usb-c-cable-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review: Anker USB C to Lightning Cable" />

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/anker-lightning-usb-c-cable-review/">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2273 aligncenter u-featured&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/04/IMG_1290-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;260&quot;
  height=&quot;347&quot; /&gt;Anker recently released a USB C to lightning cable, and while
  there are dozens of USB A to lightning cables out there, USB C cables which
  are approved for iPhone are new.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  My first impression after opening the Anker box is that this cable is thick,
  when compared side by side with an Apple cable it isn't that much thicker
  though - just enough to give one a feeling of solidity, I plan to keep this
  cable in my on the go cable bag and am confident it won't be as susceptible to
  the kinks that inevitably happen with thinner cables.¬†As with all Anker
  cables, it comes with a nice cable tidy on the cable - as these attach to the
  cable with a mini loop they don't go missing easily, and that means that with
  my always on the go everywhere lifestyle my cables are more likely to stay
  wrangled.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;wp-image-2272 aligncenter&quot;
    src=&quot;/assets/2019/04/IMG_1284-2.jpg&quot;
    alt=&quot;&quot;
    width=&quot;382&quot;
    height=&quot;382&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The cable works like you would expect it to work, I plugged the USB C end into
  my MacBook Air charger, and the other into my iPhone Xs Max with the battery
  pack attached, I did not try to measure the speed scientifically, but it felt
  like it charged just as fast as the Apple USB C cable which is what is most
  important for me! I also used it this morning to pair my Magic Keyboard to my
  MacBook Air - and as expected, it worked fine!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img

    height=&quot;362&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  What I do like about this cable is the rounded corners and moulding where the
  connectors connect to the cable - these are less likely to snag on things, and
  combined with the thicker casing on the cable itself also increases its
  lifetime for people who bend their cables near the connectors. We all know
  someone who abuses cables and probably internally wince when they do so to
  ours!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Anker's Lightning to USB C cable is definitely well made, and with it being
  cheaper than the Apple version I'd wholeheartedly recommend it instead if
  you're in the market for a cable that can connect your Mac to your iPhone,
  AirPods, or new iPad (aside from the latest Pro models) directly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Anker for sending me this cable to review!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-19-shortcuts-updates/">&lt;p&gt;
  In episode 19 of Automators David and I dive into recent updates to Shortcuts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  David has recently updated his
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.macsparky.com/p/siri?affcode=256645_0ohxw3fs&quot;
    &gt;Siri Shortcuts Field Guide&lt;/a
  &gt;, and if you listen to the podcast there's a discount code you can use to get
  a $10 discount - he's added a lot of videos which are great!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/Hlw0f_yRKRM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In the episode I talked about my backup and restore setup for Shortcuts - the
  thing that saved me when I &quot;lost&quot; hundreds of Shortcuts! First of all, you can
  find out how many shortcuts you have with this Shortcut:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2f04240d256b49c780d77530df9df9ec&quot;
    &gt;Count &amp;amp; List Shortcuts&lt;/a
  &gt;. It explicitly ignores any untitled shortcuts - as those are ones which I
  created once to use and haven't got around to deleting. The next step is to&lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7a18de96f9a84dbdae40d24b19720801&quot;
    &gt;Backup Shortcuts&lt;/a
  &gt;
  - I chose to do this as an archive, because it simplifies the process in the
  next shortcut -
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/be7ca75a462748388f70ad10c07957d0&quot;
    &gt;Install Missing Shortcut&lt;/a
  &gt;. Even if you aren't having problems with your Shortcuts it never hurts to
  back them up, this way if you like me get stuck in a corner due to betas then
  you can uninstall and reinstall with no qualms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/zWs6EiPTwwo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When we were talking about the 2.2 update and what it will bring to Notes, I
  mentioned you could use a shortcut to handle the possibility of multiple notes
  - in fact you can use one Shortcut to handle this possibility with anything.
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f2f0cac55a094588806c668b7f63402e&quot;
    &gt;Handle Multiple&lt;/a
  &gt;
  is a mini shortcut which lets you handle possible multiple inputs - if it just
  has one, be that a note, file, contact, or indeed anything, it returns it,
  otherwise it lets you choose and returns the chosen item. It's quite clever
  that you can provide input to a shortcut without it needing to be able to
  accept it - this keeps it out of your share sheet. To set this up though I did
  enable that to use the magic variables for Shortcut Input, and then I turned
  it off again.
&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/my-wishes-for-ios-13/">&lt;p&gt;Apparently it's the season where everyone speculates on what might be coming at WWDC, while I'm personally hoping for new iMacs on the hardware front, there's a few things that I could see benefitting us on the software front, so just in case Craig's reading - I've been on my best behaviour this year ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that these are in no particular order, other than that it seemed logical at the time and in many cases this was the order things occurred to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Picture In Picture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Picture in Picture. More often than not on a plane you'll see me using my iPad in split screen with Drafts and DevonThink or Dash on the other side of my screen, and picture in picture moving from corner to corner. The problem is I have to keep moving the picture so I can see the information I'm looking for. I would love it if it could take the bottom third of the screen when doing the big small app split, or a bottom quarter when doing a 50/50 split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Better Downtime Controls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Downtime, but it's turned off on my devices most of the time. This is because I have an irregular schedule - sometimes I get up at 3am to record Podcasts, and other times it's just very early for flights (it doesn't handle timezone changes too well either). I would love to be able to set multiple downtime modes, and assign them to different times of the day (layering on top of one another) - ban myself from accessing my work apps after work, and disable it for one day when I need to. I'd also love to be able to control it via the control center, Siri, and Shortcuts - turning on one of my Downtime modes. You can already customise which days you enable it on and for which times on those days - this is an excellent start, let's take it up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More multi tasking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3 Apps at Once&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to be able to see 3 apps at once properly, now I don't always need this - but for people with a 12.9&quot; iPad I can see this coming in handy, being able to see a PDF and Safari for reference, plus the document you're writing. This might never make it to any other devices, and I could live with that (despite having a 11&quot; iPad Pro), but this would be great for those the times when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Two versions of the same app&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is an application I don't particularly enjoy using, but I get a fair number of documents in Word format, trying to compare those, or reference one and edit the other is an exercise in frustration. More and more apps are building their own version of split view, but if iOS could offer the framework to open multiple instances of the app at once, that would be a great help - sliding one over the other with slideover would be very useful. I presume iOS would prevent users from opening two instances of one document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shortcuts Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we've had Shortcuts for a good amount of time and I've had a good chance to play with it, there are still a few things I would wish for. These are mostly related to making things more Siriable - so I wouldn't need to interact with the device physically after having triggered a shortcut via Siri.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask for Input is a really powerful action, if this could be transformed into Siri reading the hint/question, and dictation working as the response that would be extremely useful - I would only expect this to happen when the Shortcut was run through Siri, and the dictation would have to figure out how to stop itself (perhaps just use the standard dictation action which ends on a pause/after a not too long a period of time?) - but this would allow many automations to become hands and eyes free.  The problem with current approach is you must decide if you will run this shortcut via voice, or directly from Shortcuts/the widget and prefer to type. It would be very useful if this could be dynamic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Full Screen Text Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when we use the Text action for much more than it was intended, and this can mean that we have virtual novels in there. The problem with the text box is that it never adapts to the contents, so you are limited to the few lines and whatever the width of your device allows. I would love to see a feature where if you tap into a text box it expands to fill the screen allowing you to edit to your heart's content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choose from Menus &amp;amp; Lists through Voice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has been stuck in a phone tree at some point in their life, &quot;Press 1 to talk to sales, press 2 to request a statement, press 3 if you hope to talk to a person sometime today&quot; (no offence to sales, but they always seem to have about 500 more levels of phone tree inside of their options!). This isn't perfect, but it's familiar and it works. This goes back to running a Shortcut via Siri though, if there's a menu or a list you have to tap to pick an option - being able to do that via voice in some way or another would be amazing. Being able to choose one of a number of options through voice would make running many of my existing shortcuts through Siri easier - and I would run them more on my HomePod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unset Variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just need variables for a short amount of time. Magic variables are fabulous - but not always what you want (and especially if you're restructuring things you had already made without magic variables - though that's becoming less and less of an issue with time, you might not have used them). What I would like is an additional action to unset a variable - so after that is done it no longer shows up in the list of variables, and no longer has any content. This would mostly make life easier when reworking longer automations, and for people not used to Shortcuts yet.  It would also let you immediately see below that action where the Variable has been used - assuming it turns red like magic variables do when you delete the action that creates them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Define Your Own Function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run a Shortcut inside a Shortcut, which is then just like a function. I now have numerous Shortcuts in my library which are only ever run as a function - I would love to see the option to mark these as such, so they never show up in my share sheet, and perhaps allow me to filter quickly for these when I'm editing a &quot;Run Shortcut&quot; action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Organisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of filtering - please for the love of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=289v_gKJjWU&quot;&gt;Clarus&lt;/a&gt;, let us organise our Shortcuts in some manner. Folders, tags, at this stage I don't really care (probably folders, considering the poor treatment tags get in Files on iOS), but let me group and organise Shortcuts in a manner logical to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mac Version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably a way off, but if we could get Shortcuts on the Mac then I think a lot of people would be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; excited. URL Schemes are already supported, and just the ability to edit these things on yet another one of your devices would be much appreciated. Automator's limitations from the built in actions really show in comparison to Shortcuts, (e.g. the add Calendar Event action in Automator only lets you hard code dates/times natively, whereas Shortcuts allows you to type &quot;next Tuesday at 9am&quot; and will calculate the date for you).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More System Controls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things people would love to control through Shortcuts, from VPN to which Airplay device music should play to. These would deepen the amazing integration that's already there and I can't see anyone being upset that you can control a VPN when you can already control the Wifi.&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä©### Allow Donation of More Powerful Actions&lt;br /&gt;
iOS 12 made an impressive start by allowing app developers to donate (that's really the term) Shortcuts to Siri, I hope to see iOS 13 take this up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Accept Input and Return Output&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the donated Shortcuts could accept input and return output instead of requiring us to work around things with the clipboard this would both make things more flexible for us as users, and preserve our clipboards too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Editable Actions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donated actions are &quot;finished&quot; items right now - you can't edit them, this is fine if there is an equivalent way to create this action yourself, but what I'm personally finding is that a donated action is a great one, but I would like to use it as the base for something else quite often. Being able to specify which OmniFocus Perspective I'd like to open by typing the name, or choosing from a list would be a boon, and hopefully would also clear up some of the &lt;code&gt;Send a message to Mum &quot;I'm running 5 minutes late&quot;&lt;/code&gt; littering my action list right now.‚Ä©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shortcuts App Store&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have stickers, why not shortcuts? This would be a way for Apple to extend the gallery, whilst also giving people a vetted source of Shortcuts (assuming there is a Shortcuts review). I would think this would require some way to hide the actions in a Shortcut - perhaps a &quot;Run Only&quot; mode for these. I'm sure that the MacStories collection would become available in short order, and I would be happy to make Shortcuts and put them on the Shortcuts store too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;iMessage Shortcuts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iMessage apps may not have been as popular as Apple envisioned, but letting us program our own Shortcuts to use in iMessage with just a tap would make life easier for everything from sharing availability to rick rolling your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;watchOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is stolen from Twitter, but I would love to see this grid based dock in the next version of watchOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Another major element I‚Äôd love is a grid-based dock. I was not a fan of the watchOS 4 update to this page and this would make me a lot happier. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OuErrNcyJO&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/OuErrNcyJO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-17-live-at-podcon/">&lt;p&gt;Episode 17 of Automators comes to you live from PodCon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;TripIt - Automated Trip Itinerary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;alignright&quot;
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/02/tripit-itinerary.png&quot;
    width=&quot;257&quot;
    height=&quot;510&quot;
  /&gt;I personally use TripIt to create my itineraries - it actually automates
  everything for me. I could let it read my email inbox and auto create
  itineraries, but I prefer to choose which emails to forward to it. As I
  mentioned on the show I also have a filter in Gmail that marks and read and
  deletes all of the &quot;Your TripIt Itinerary was imported&quot; emails - I only need
  to do something if it didn't work after all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bear Notes for Trips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  David rolls his own travel schedule system - with Bear. The advantage of Bear
  is you can easily add attachments and text to a document, meaning everything
  is in the same place. You can even use a nice Shortcut to allow you to append
  a document or text to a specific Bear note:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c99cab3bf76b4121bda45fb5e1a471f2&quot;
    &gt;Append to Bear&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Zapier Turning New Trips into OmniFocus Projects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This is an automation I mentioned that is a little hacky, but it works well
  for me. TripIt creates a calendar, or you can use any of your own calendars
  for this if you don't want to use TripIt - you just need to get that calendar
  into Google Calendar. What we do is we watch this calendar for new events,
  then we filter - continuing if the length of the event is more than 23 hours.
  Then I use the text action to write up the TaskPaper I want to be added to
  OmniFocus, and URL encode it. The final step is to add a task to OmniFocus -
  this is accomplished via the MailDrop, and it has a URL scheme which looks
  something like
  &lt;code
    &gt;omnifocus:///paste?target=/folder/Travel&amp;amp;content=
    -%202019/09%20-%20Amsterdam%0A%09-%20Organise%20Travel&lt;/code
  &gt;
  in the body - so when this task arrives in my inbox and I process it, I just
  tap on the URL to add the project. You can even run a Shortcut via a URL
  scheme (which I usually do!). The Zapier steps are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    New Event
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Watch the specific calendar in Google Calendar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Only Continue If
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Duration (hours)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Greater than&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;23&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Text (Formatter)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        I typed my TaskPaper in here, and URL encoded it, if you already have
        the URL encoded text, or another URL you want to appear in the body of
        the task ready you can skip this step.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Create Task
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        The title is &quot;Set up project for trip &lt;em&gt;Event Name&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, which I also
        include in the Text action above. The body is the URL I will tap on when
        I process the task.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This series of steps is a pretty solid way to add projects and tasks to
  OmniFocus based on other events happening, I use it for lots of automations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rose's Packing List Shortcut&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/4gJfgDKWH8k&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I use a modular approach to create my packing list - along with an extra list
  of devices to charge! While I save this to OmniFocus you could easily modify
  this to work in any task management system, or just to create a PDF to print
  if that's what you prefer to do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Naming Documents with Scanner Pro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;alignright&quot;
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2019/02/scanner-pro-workflow.png&quot;
    width=&quot;186&quot;
    height=&quot;369&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Scanner Pro is an app David and I both use to scan documents on the go - as
  well as when we're on the road. It has built-in OCR, and Workflows which allow
  you to chain multiple actions together. Most of the time I use a Workflow
  called &quot;Simple Scan&quot; which formats the name to
  &lt;em
    &gt;Scan &lt;code&gt;Year&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Month&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Day&lt;/code&gt;,
    &lt;code&gt;Time&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em
  &gt;
  and saves the document as a PDF to Dropbox. I usually save to a specific
  folder in Dropbox which Hazel then watches and automatically files certain
  things or me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Airmail Custom Actions for a Trip&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Airmail is a mail app for power users, especially with its custom actions. I
  have a custom action which forwards the email to TripIt and then moves it to
  my Gmail account's Travel tag, this allows me to find all my travel email
  quickly if I need it, and gets it into TripIt without me needing to remember
  to forward it as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Quickly Add Travel to your Calendar with Shortcuts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This Shortcut isn't really generic, but hopefully, it will inspire some of
  you. To get to the airport I take a tram and then a train (at least most of
  the time). The tram normally takes 11 minutes to get to the train station, and
  then the train should take 16 minutes to get to the airport. While I could use
  the public transit API to get all of the information to figure out my route to
  the airport I prefer to look at the available times in the app and choose
  which one I would prefer to take - before adding this to my calendar. This
  Shortcut asks me for the departure and arrival time for each mode of transport
  (and automatically suggests the arrival time based on the departure time)
  allowing me to just input 2 dates and times most of the time. You can grab it
  here:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/26bc7c0e410e4e8baa5c68227a6486e9&quot;
    &gt;Airport Travel&lt;/a
  &gt;.

  Episode 15 of Automators has arrived - and with it our secrets for automating
  time tracking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Time tracking is something some people are required to do, some people ought
  to do, and something everyone should try at least once just so you can see
  where all your time is going and how many of those &quot;it will just take 2
  minute&quot; tasks really take 45 minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  David and Mike Schmitz talked about how to figure out what you shouldn't be
  doing in
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/focused/53&quot;
    &gt;episode 53 of Focused (formerly Free Agents)&lt;/a
  &gt;, and that's one of the things I've kept an eye on through my time tracking -
  things that are taking a lot of my time, that I don't truly enjoy doing or
  that I know aren't beneficial to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Oversleeping Tracker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now, depending on the day of the week, this should perhaps more accurately be
  called my &quot;lazing in bed&quot; tracker, I title it oversleeping by default - you
  could call it whatever you like. This is is a solid example of a tracker which
  should automatically start at a specific time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  To make it I kept things simple - the trigger is the schedule action, set for
  6am in my case. I have set it not to run on Saturdays and Sundays. Then the
  actions are as follows: Toggl, start a time entry (not create!) - I set the
  workspace, project (called Personal), and add a description of &quot;Oversleeping&quot;.
  The final action is to send myself a Pushbullet link notification. I
  misremembered during the episode but I am actually triggering a Shortcut, the
  link is simply &lt;code&gt;shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=Stop%20Toggl&lt;/code&gt; (you
  can download the Shortcut
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/dfacc8698cdd45a59929ae8768555581&quot;
    &gt;here&lt;/a
  &gt;, you'll need to have the Toggl app installed for it to work), and the title
  is actually the description of the Toggl timer - so if I change what I put in
  the description later I don't need to remember to update the notification
  name. If you're on the free version of Toggl then you'll have to skip the
  notification part.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  That's it! When the Zap runs it starts the timer, and sends me a notification
  - and when I open that notification it opens Shortcuts, which stops the timer.
  You could have it open the Toggl web page instead - or any number of things if
  you wanted to do so. (You could also run a different Shortcut, one which
  starts playing your morning playlist, tells you what events are on your
  calendar, etc., as well as stopping the timer.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Zapier Stop Timer Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This one does the opposite of the above - it stops a currently running timer
  at 10pm. The trick with this is you will need to use the Toggl API, and as
  such you'll need a premium Zapier plan to do this (you could use Microsoft
  Flow if you're comfortable doing the whole thing via APIs though, and that's
  free!). So, how does it work?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Every day at 10pm is the schedule which triggers this, I have it run on
    weekends too.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    GET - I make a call to the Toggl API. I call the URL
    &lt;code&gt;https://www.toggl.com/api/v8/time_entries/current&lt;/code&gt;, and make
    sure to fill out the Basic Auth field with &lt;code&gt;email|password&lt;/code&gt;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Only continue if: the data returned by Toggl has a negative duration if the
    timer is still running, so if it's less than zero I continue.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop Time Entry - using the ID captured from the GET in step 2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Send a link via PushBullet. This opens the alternative Toggl app I'm beta
    testing so I can just continue the timer if necessary.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  A note: while I am doing some of my Toggl automations through IFTTT that is
  via their Maker service and the API, it doesn't have direct integration with
  Toggl itself.

	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/review-satechi-75w-dual-type-c-pd-travel-charger</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/review-satechi-75w-dual-type-c-pd-travel-charger/">&lt;p&gt;Everything is changing to USB C - great! But also, eek. That means it's time for new chargers. Now, I'll grant you, I'm a nerd and I love shopping for new chargers! But trying to find one I want, that charges the devices I want, which can be shipped to me (Austria uses Amazon Germany, and as many residents of Austria are aware, lots of things &quot;Cannot be shipped to Austria&quot; - for reasons unknown) is actually not that fun after 3 hours of trying to figure it all out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary search criteria over the last few months has been &quot;more than one USB C port&quot;, this has been a challenge, to say the least. One of the things I decided I was willing to capitulate on early on was that it should also be able to charge my MacBook Pro. I love my 15&quot; device, but in hindsight maybe I should have gone 13&quot; - as then it just needs 60W of power. But as a friend said not long ago, when does the 15&quot; really need 87W of power? For intensive things yes, but for writing scripts, blog posts, even running MAMP as my virtual server? Not so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then CES happened. As always, there were lots of shinies - some of which are weird and probably won't be seen or heard from again. However, there were also the &quot;ready to ship&quot; things, including a new charger from Satechi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This charger is the success to my previous Anker 5 port charger - one of those ports being a USB C PD port. The Satechi though, has 2 USB C ports, one 60W, one 18W (handily noted in very small font below the ports), and 2 USB A ports. So technically I'm losing a port - but as I always take a small single USB A port device with me for use in the airport I can manage if I really need 5 ports at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been putting the charger through its paces since I got it on Tuesday, and I'm impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using the 60W port for my MacBook Pro, it works, it's a little slower than the 87W when the device is in use - but I can live with that. The 18W has been used for my iPad Pro and Nintendo Switch, it works great - they both charge quickly with no issues. The other two ports have an Apple Watch cable plugged in, and an Anker 3 in 1 cable (Micro USB, Lightning, USB C), the latter for charging my iPhone, AirPods, Bose headphones, and also for powering my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/my-raspberry-pi-zero-w-portable-development-server&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi Zero Portable development server&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, chargers get warm when using them, it's currently charging my MBP (which is asleep), this iPad which I'm writing the blog post on, my Apple Watch and my iPhone XS Max. If I touch the charger it's slightly warm, that's it. When I was using my MacBook Pro earlier today and charging my Bose headphones, and Nintendo Switch it got a little warmer, but still pleasant to touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why I wanted this charger is it takes a standard figure of 8 cable, and it's 110V-240V. That means I can just swap the cable and use it at home in Europe, as well as here in the US (it wasn't available for purchase in the EU and as I was on my way here it seemed like an opportune moment to get it!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/review-satechi-75w-dual-type-c-pd-travel-charger/satechi-charger.jpeg&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/review-satechi-75w-dual-type-c-pd-travel-charger/satechi-charger.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it look like? Size wise, similar to my 87W MBP charger - it's a little longer, but also shorter, thickness and weight wise they feel about the same. It's space grey, and has one cable coming out of the back for power, and depending on what you want to charge, up to 4 out of the front - that means it can look a little messy but for the price of power I'll take it! It does have a blue LED on the front, thankfully it's quite dim and hasn't disturbed my sleep over the last few nights. That being said, when I get home I'll put some electrical tape over it - there's nothing worse than a light when you're trying to sleep and can't - it may as well be the eye of Sauron!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Just send it to your Kindle email address, or connect your Kindle to your computer and copy the .mobi file over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as Ryan says on the blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ePub has slightly improved chapter and section markers whilst the PDF has been rebuilt with a PDF table of contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? For existing customers all of this can be downloaded in the downloads area on the blog (if you can't log in please use the contact form on the OmniFocus book website). For anyone considering purchasing the book: the launch sale ends January 11th, that's this Friday. After that the price will go up to $30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who has sent such lovely feedback on the book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note: we intend this book to &quot;live&quot;, as such when OmniFocus gets new features it will be updated to cover those - and those will be free updates too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the book on the website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://omnifocusbook.com&quot;&gt;OmniFocusBook.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  topic for this episode I jumped on it. I subscribed to Day One last year and
  have been trying to improve my usage of it, this episode forced me to go

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/dual-sim-iphone-xs-max-review-3-months-on/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dual Sim iPhone XS Max Review - 3 Months On" />
	  <published>2019-01-03T10:00:00+00:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/dual-sim-iphone-xs-max-review-3-months-on</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/dual-sim-iphone-xs-max-review-3-months-on/">&lt;p&gt;When the iPhones were announced last year I had decided before the event that I wasn't upgrading, and for a while after the event I held out - until I found out I could get a real dual sim iPhone XS Max from Hong Kong, which means no restrictions or modifications to iOS, and real dual sim capabilities. When it dropped in price a little I caved and flexed my credit card. (For the curious I found the iPhone on eBay from a UK seller - I picked the seller with the highest ratings and everything went smoothly.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why dual sim? For many people this is unnecessary, in my case I am fortunate enough to have both my work mobile number and my personal mobile number on one sim, however I have an older personal number, and my UK number which I still receive messages on - and in the case of the UK sim I often use it when travelling (both to the UK and other places as the provider, Three, offer good travel packages). Some people have separate work and personal sims, and it's definitely nice to have the option of switching sims when travelling if only to get a cheaper data plan, whilst being able to keep your regular number to receive incoming calls or messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it's pretty simple to use and works precisely as documented by Apple, you pop out the sim tray, the sim on the back is held in with a small plastic spring and the one on the front is held in with gravity. Once you put the sims in you get asked how you want to use them, and off you go. I don't have an e-sim option at all, which means if I travel somewhere and want a local sim I'll have to buy it first. That said, in most countries there's only one e-sim provider and they're usually not the cheapest so I probably wouldn't use them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing missing from this setup is the ability to use both numbers with iMessage - unfortunately you're limited to using the primary number with FaceTime and iMessage. However in my case I chose to use my email address as my primary contact information for iMessage a long time ago which alleviates that issue quite nicely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to the Max itself. I was previously a member of the of &lt;em&gt;the Plus club&lt;/em&gt; (as it was christened by the fabulous hosts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://relay.fm/connected&quot;&gt;Connected&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017 I thought that the X would be perfect for me and it was indeed an excellent device - but I really do like the bigger screen! With the Max I caved to the trends and bought a pop socket as recommended on &lt;a href=&quot;https://relay.fm/cortex&quot;&gt;Cortex&lt;/a&gt; - and my little finger is very thankful for this as I have previously rested the iPhone on that finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very exciting part of the S and R series of iPhones of course is the ability to read NFC tags without opening an app first - this is going to be a great automation possibility, simply because I can be prompted to run automations when I put my iPhone down in specific places such as by my bed. I'm very sure app developers are going to be taking advantage of this! Launch Center Pro has already updated to support this ability and it's coming in handy - for everything from triggering shortcuts to accessing OmniFocus perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I had not realised I was missing was battery life. With my X I needed to charge the device most evenings when getting home from work, now I can make it until bedtime and I often have about 40% battery remaining (unless I play Pok√©mon Go, which requires a battery pack on any device). I've already seen how useful this is on trips - while I always have a battery pack handy it's nice not to need it, or at least to not be tethered to it. I won't be travelling long haul until I visit Seattle for PodCon later this month - but I suspect with low power mode I would be able to get by with just a small battery pack if I choose to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I'm very happy with the Xs Max and don't regret getting it at all. Was my X good? Definitely! And I wouldn't recommend this move to most people, but for me it definitely resulted in benefits so was definitely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  In episode 13 of Automators we got to interview David Barnard from Contrast -
  the company behind Launch Center Pro which was just updated this week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I've been a big fan of
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id532016360?at=1010lumu&quot;
    &gt;Launch Center Pro&lt;/a
  &gt;
  for years, it was around long before Shortcuts and has a massive collection of
  URL schemes in it for starters. You may well be thinking that now we have
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id915249334?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/a
  &gt;,

  and more we don't need Launch Center Pro anymore though - and we dive into
  this in the podcast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Launch Center Pro can do automations by itself, anything which can be done via
  URL scheme is triggerable - but that's not all. It offers a GUI to build a URL
  scheme (which you could take and use elsewhere if you wanted to). You can also
  specify that you want user input in a variety of formats, choosing from a
  list, keyboard or numberpad input, scanning a barcode, dictation and more!
  Launch Center Pro can also URL encode text for you if it's placed in
  &lt;code&gt;double%20curly%20brackets&lt;/code&gt; - and to make things more user friendly
  you put in one of the GUI fields when building a URL scheme will be preserved
  exactly as you have written it and wrapped in those brackets allowing you to
  edit it easily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Time Based Launchers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you want to remember to check the weather at 7am everyday, look in
  TestFlight for beta updates, or to send a message at 5pm then you can achieve
  this with Launch Center Pro, it can do anything from launching a
  mind-bogglingly long list of apps, to anything which can be done through URL
  schemes (and more, but I'll get to that). In the new version you can
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;One Off Alerts&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As well as alerts appearing every Wednesday at 9pm you can also have a one
  time alert appear, this is ideal for things like &quot;I need to ask my boyfriend
  X, Y and Z via WhatsApp&quot;, I can just modify the text that will be sent and set
  the alert to trigger say 30 minutes after my flight lands.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Location Based Launchers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Launching maps for your route to work everyday at 8am is all very well, but
  wouldn't it be better to have that trigger when you leave your house? Launch
  Center Pro can prompt you to do things like this based on location - you can
  have something prompt you when you arrive a location, leave it, or both.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;iBeacons&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  GPS is great, but it's also not the most accurate, so when I arrive at work I
  like to check my OmniFocus work perspective (rather than seeing how many tasks
  I have which need to be completed at work), but if I use GPS I'll get prompted
  when I get off the tram outside, which means when I actually get into my
  office on the 6th floor about 10 minutes later I will have forgotten or
  dismissed the notification already, or worse still looked at the perspective
  and forgotten what I'd seen in it. To alleviate this issue I use iBeacons -
  little devices used for indoor location tracking. They're not hard to setup,
  just copy the iBeacon ID into the field in LCP and let it do the work. I have
  one I put in my suitcase too when travelling which means I can toggle on my
  travel launchers for reminders when arriving at/leaving my hotel room easily.
  The one at work lives in my desk drawer and it usually triggers between me
  exiting the lift and actually getting into my room which is perfect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Time and Location Based Launchers&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Location based things are great, but if I go past the supermarket on a Sunday
  there's no point in reminding me to buy juice - the supermarket is closed (in
  Austria most retail locations are closed on Sundays). I use a really nice
  feature to limit when these location based reminders pop up, so if I'm on my
  way home from the airport at midnight then the location based trigger won't
  show up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;NFC Tags&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  NFC tags are brand new to Launch Center Pro 3 - they're truly techie stickers
  which can trigger a notification when you touch them, and the ones from the
  Contrast Shop will let you attach them to Launch Center Pro 3 and actions
  within it. You can even attach the same sticker to more than one action, and
  then pick from the provided menu when you open the notification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Quick Access to &lt;em&gt;Stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Some apps have things buried deep in menus, or you simply need to scroll a lot
  to get to it. Launch Center Pro can frequently give you speedy access to
  things - such as next month in Fantastical, a new email to a specific person
  in Airmail, or prepare actions for you such as starting a new Glympse and
  sending it via email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As promised on the show, this is my shortcut to weigh myself. I have FitBit
  scales and unfortunately they don't sync to the health app. Rather than use
  another ap to sync from FitBit to Health I just input the data directly - and
  have it calculate my BMI at the same time for an extra data point: [Log Scales
  Data](whilst it:

  &gt;).

	  <published>2018-12-08T08:45:00+00:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/announcment-build-your-omnifocus-workflow</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/announcment-build-your-omnifocus-workflow/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/announcment-build-your-omnifocus-workflow/build-your-omnifocus-workflow.png){.image-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/12/build-your-omnifocus-workflow.png&quot; width=&quot;362&quot; height=&quot;513&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today I'm very excited to announce a book: Build Your OmniFocus Workflow. I've been hard at work on this for the last 3 months - but not alone. My fabulous co-author, Ryan Dotson, has been hard at work right along side me (admittedly with a timezone difference) - and we have 150 pages ready for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is designed, as the name implies, to help you build a workflow which works for you with OmniFocus - whether you've never used the app before, or if you've used it for years and just want to improve your setup. It is comprised of five sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Steps&lt;/strong&gt;: Getting OmniFocus set up with a basic setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt;: Walking you through the default perspectives, and expanding on your current setup - plus diving into settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advancing&lt;/strong&gt;: Diving much deeper, including custom perspectives, creative uses for tags, review and onwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Horizons&lt;/strong&gt;: Honing your workflow to get the most out of your system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Workflows&lt;/strong&gt;: Ryan and I get personal and tell you about how our setups work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book there are tips, notes, personal comments, and most important of all: activities for you to complete in order for you to create a set up which allows you to be productive and which will hopefully also allow you to feel like you're fully in control of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;OmniFocus is a remarkably flexible app and can adapt to practically any workflow. As such, everyone must go through the process of building their own workflow with it, whether from scratch or based upon someone else‚Äôs. Build Your OmniFocus Workflow, written with the insight of two long-time OmniFocus users, offers practical advice on top of solid technical information. Ryan and Rose guide you through the basic concepts and perspectives of OmniFocus and into the more complex world of custom perspectives and automation. All throughout they give their own interpretations of how they use features in their workflows and finish the book with more details about how their systems work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build Your OmniFocus Workflow is available for a short time at launch for $25. The price will increase in the new year to $30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is not static, we intend to update it when new features are added to any of the OmniFocus platforms. That is not to say the book is incomplete, we have about 40,000 words and are very happy to release it today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to the nerdier side of things. You may be thinking &quot;I've never heard of Ryan&quot; - and until I started beta testing OmniFocus 3 for iOS I hadn't either! In fact, Ryan and I have never actually met in person - the internet put us together (with some help from The Omni Group), and we ended up writing a book. If that's not a testament to how wonderful the world can be I don't know what is! I'm going to go through a little of how we wrote the book, just to give you a taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started by mapping ideas out in iThoughts. We thought we'd write Markdown files and check them into a private GitHub repo - but for a variety of reasons realised this wasn't going to work how we had originally envisioned so quickly moved over to Scrivener where the project has been ever since. Scrivener has excellent Dropbox sync support so we worked through that, back and forth - with differing timezones coming in handy as you can only have one copy of a Scrivener file open at once. Once we had a large chunk of the book written then came the hard part: formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a confession, I had very little input on the formatting. By which I mean the styling formatting rather than the organisation of the book. Ryan had a hidden talent for this from which I have learnt a great deal! If you think the book looks pretty that's down to him. From the font choices, to the indentation, and the whimsy of the hands for the notes and tips, Ryan did all the hard work. Just don't ask him about list formatting, he's still recovering from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cover design was done by the extremely talented Josh Hughes. Josh has also designed a series of icons for OmniFocus custom perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://omnifocusbook.com&quot;&gt;Get the book here!&lt;/a&gt; If you're not sure (understandable), then you can also get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://omnifocusbook.com/product/sample-chapter/&quot;&gt;free sample&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-11-shortcuts-home-screens/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automators 11: Shortcuts Home Screens" />
	  <published>2018-11-23T21:00:00+00:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-11-shortcuts-home-screens</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-11-shortcuts-home-screens/">&lt;p&gt;
  The world has gone wild for Shortcuts home screens - including David and
  myself! In episode 11 of Automators we have gone into why you might want to
  try this crazy fad and how we're using it ourselves, so - let's dive in!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  There's numerous reasons why you might want to have Shortcuts on your home
  screen:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To run your shortcut, yes - an obvious one, but a worthy one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    To give you context - e.g. when I tap on my Automators icon I get the
    options I want when I'm wearing my Automators hat.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To run multiple actions at once - such as starting a timer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    To put one app or shortcut in multiple places, so Quip is in my Learn
    OmniFocus and my Automators shortcuts, but the Quip app itself could only be
    in one folder.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To assist less technical folks with an iOS device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can build these Shortcuts very simply: with a
  &lt;code&gt;Choose from Menu&lt;/code&gt; and either &lt;code&gt;Open App&lt;/code&gt; or
  &lt;code&gt;Run Shortcut&lt;/code&gt; actions. I put together a short YouTube video on
  that for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrC0OKEqRBM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One of the examples Shortcuts I talked about was my Home shortcut, this lets
  me choose from different scenes at different times of day - something you may
  want to incorporate into other Shortcuts, here's how it works:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;alignnone&quot;
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/11/example-time-shortcut.jpeg&quot;
    width=&quot;469&quot;
    height=&quot;1488&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The trick is to format the date action to give you just the hour, and then you
  can nest if actions to get what you want. You can download this Shortcut
  sample
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b89a529f95c8415a8fcbb2f87823e5d3&quot;
    &gt;here&lt;/a
  &gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  David talked about his Shortcut to take a nap - it sets an alarm and turns on
  Do Not Disturb. You can download that Shortcut here, it will ask you how long
  you want to take naps for too:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6c6a4d818a794a1faf6a0475c579d4dd&quot;
    &gt;Take a Nap&lt;/a
  &gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  David made a video where you can see how he does his different contexts with
  Shortcuts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtHntEP39bk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And you can download a sample Shortcut
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/32e31b62b76041c0875dab2798f3c9c3&quot;
    &gt;here&lt;/a
  &gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We also dived into customising Shortcuts, as promised here's a Shortcut to put
  that blank character on your clipboard so you can have Shortcuts with no name:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4c047002c4e64aba889503c1bb288cd1&quot;
    &gt;Copy Whitespace&lt;/a
  &gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As we mentioned on the show, you can put Shortcuts just like these in a widget
  too - and here's a bonus trick for you. Tap on &lt;code&gt;Show More&lt;/code&gt; on your
  Shortcuts Widget, and then at the bottom tap
  &lt;code&gt;Customise in Shortcuts&lt;/code&gt; - this lets you enable and disable
  Shortcuts in the widget, as well as change the order of them quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Since we recorded the show Federico Vittici, Shortcuts nerd par excellence,
  has created a wonderful Home Screen Shortcuts Shortcut which you can check out
  over on MacStories:
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/ios/home-screen-icon-creator-a-shortcut-to-create-custom-icons-for-apps-contacts-solid-colors-and-more/&quot;

    Contacts, Solid Colors, and More ‚Äì MacStories&lt;/a
  &gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/coming-soon-automating-omnifocus-3-using-siri-shortcuts/">&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves Automation, or at least what it can do for them - and I'm a big fan (you may have guessed!). I've teamed up with Tim Stringer to produce automation focused content for his site &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnomnifocus.com/?ref=16&quot;&gt;Learn OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend Tim is offering 25% off annual membership, and on top of that he is donating 20% of the income from this to CARE Canada (&lt;a href=&quot;https://learnomnifocus.com/black-friday-giving-tuesday-2018/?ref=16&quot;&gt;get the details here&lt;/a&gt; - make sure to get the coupon code!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first session Tim and I have planned I'm going to get you started with OmniFocus and Siri Shortcuts - triggering OmniFocus perspectives with your voice, and building simple Shortcuts. We already have a second session planned for January too where we'll dive deeper into what Shortcuts can automate in OmniFocus for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some other great sessions coming up too:&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/ipad-11-first-impressions/">&lt;p&gt;My iPad Pro 11&quot; with Smart Keyboard folio and Apple Pencil arrived just before 10am on Wednesday (earlier than I could have got it at the Apple Store) and I've been putting it through its paces ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/11/ipad-pro-11.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight away I was impressed with the screen, it's big and beautiful - and more importantly, hasn't increased the size of the device at all from the 10.5&quot; iPad. I have several bags I love which fitted the 10.5&quot; iPad perfectly - and I'm very pleased to report that my 11&quot; iPad is not going to require a change in my handbag collection üòâ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After attaching the Smart Keyboard folio I became slightly concerned by the weight of the device, but I weighed it very scientifically - with the 10.5&quot; and Smart Keyboard in one hand and the 11&quot; and Smart Keyboard folio in the other, there's not much of a difference in it, and as I won't be using the leather slip case anymore I have no qualms about the weight. Scientifically it's about 50g heavier than the 10.5&quot; iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard. The Smart Keyboard folio itself is good, slightly clickier than the previous ones - especially on the space bar. It is sturdier than the previous model in my lap which is where I frequently use it. The second angle is however essentially useless to me, much too steep unless I'm putting the iPad on a relatively high table to watch media on. That said that second groove is a good place to put my Apple Pencil when I'm not using it if I don't want to put it on the side of the iPad for whatever reason. The Smart Keyboard is however a very boring shade of grey with just the fold and the camera cutout on the back, and not even that on the front. It would be nice if Apple offered this in a few different colours - at least on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/ipad-11-first-impressions/apple-pencil.jpeg){.image-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/11/apple-pencil.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the new Apple Pencil. I'm no artist however I use the iPad frequently to take notes by hand and sketch out ideas. The ability to switch between tools with a double tap is very useful - and I'm very pleased to see several apps such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1164289776?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;OmniGraffle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id360593530?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;Notability&lt;/a&gt; have already implemented support for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new screen size does of course bring some challenges with it - namely that apps have to update again to support these new screen sizes. Of course, I primarily use apps such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id993160329?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;Airmail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1236254471?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1346190318?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; which have all been updated for these new sizes already! Facebook however looks terrible - and I don't think they ever got around to supporting the original 12.9&quot; so I highly doubt we'll see an update there any time soon! That said I rarely use Facebook nowadays so it's no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people of course don't need to upgrade to this iPad Pro from the last one - and for most people I'd even suggest they get the older generation which is still for sale in the 10.5&quot; size. I use the iPad as my primary device though, leaving my 15&quot; MacBook Pro on my desk at home when I can - and I've been looking for a larger screen size on the iPad without going back to the full size 12.9&quot; behemoth! This definitely fits that bill no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did consider ordering the 12.9&quot; - and I've looked at it in the store too, but frankly it's still too big and heavy for me. While I don't get two full size apps side by side on the 11&quot; I generally don't notice or mind - in fact in some cases like when using Shortcuts in split screen it's definitely a blessing that it scales down to be a mobile screen when I have a list or menu to select from as they get pushed to the bottom of the screen. My iPad goes almost everywhere with me and I would like to keep that up, if it's too big or heavy that won't happen and I'll go back to browsing Twitter on my iPhone instead of reading or doing something productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm definitely happy with my purchase, and this year I'm not going to keep the 12.9&quot; around as my big iPad (for one I'd have to keep two separate pencils!) - I'm consolidating my devices and am pleased the screen size of the 11&quot; will allow me to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  Episode 10 of Automators is all about Zapier. David and I both recently dove
  into Zapier plans and thought it would be a great topic for an episode - after
  all, we use it to automate Automators!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  As such, this episode goes behind the scenes and gives you some great examples
  of how you can get started with Zapier, as well as the advantages of using an
  online service for automation and some comparison to IFTTT and Microsoft Flow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I hope you enjoy the episode and look forward to hearing how you use Zapier
  and any questions you might have
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.automators.fm&quot;&gt;in the forums&lt;/a&gt;. You can get the full
  details of the blog post over on

  Episode 9 of Automators is all about Scriptable, a great app released for iOS
  12 which allows you to control your device with JavaScript. We were fortunate
  enough to have the developer of Scriptable, Simon B. St√∏vring come on the
  podcast to tell us about the app and some of the things it can do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I'm going to use this article to give you a quick overview of Scriptable - if
  I wanted to detail everything you'd probably end up reading a 10,000 word post
  and this is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be a blog post to accompany a podcast! So,
  let's get started.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Scriptable is a framework which lets you control your device by writing
  scripts - much like Shortcuts it doesn't do anything itself directly, but
  instead it enables you to write code which can do anything from check if Slack
  is down by reading a webpage, to manipulate your contacts, read an API key
  from your keychain, and even more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scriptable includes several example scripts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ASCIIwwdc: This gets the transcript for any WWDC video&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countdown to Midnight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Import Selected File to Bear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is Slack Down?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Latest News on MacStories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reminders Due Today&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vue JSON&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Watchlist: Manages a list of films you'd like to watch, which you share to
    it from the IMDB app
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    What is shared: A script which shows you how to interpret the sharesheet
    from various apps on iOS
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comic in Siri&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Inside the app there's documentation which tells you what you can do directly
  with the device, this includes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alert&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calendar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contacts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Device&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dictation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Document Picker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Message&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Photos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reminders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Safari&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  ... and much more! All of these are on top of what is regularly available in
  JavaScript - just like Drafts, Scriptable uses ES6 JavaScript, this is the
  most recent version and you can find a very comprehensive guide, plus
  tutorials on the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript&quot;
    &gt;Mozilla Developer site&lt;/a
  &gt;. We also mentioned the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/programming-with-javascript&quot;
    &gt;CodeAcademy JavaScript course&lt;/a
  &gt;
  which is good place to start learning JavaScript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Another app we mentioned during the show was
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://omz-software.com/pythonista/&quot;&gt;Pythonista&lt;/a&gt; which is a
  powerful scripting app for iOS - as you might guess from the name it's Python
  based rather than JavaScript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Every Scriptable script can be added to Siri right from it's settings page,
  this is also where you can add it to Launch Center Pro, copy the URL scheme,
  say what the script can accept as input, or specify the script should always
  run in the app - listen to the chapter at 17:59 to find out why you might need
  to do this!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Towards the end of the show Simon mentioned some of the things he was working
  on and while he couldn't make any promises when we recorded,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simonbs/status/1055761204520591361&quot;
    &gt;Scriptable has been updated today&lt;/a
  &gt;! The update includes, auto complete, interactive tables, the ability to
  evaluate JavaScript in a WebView, a new contacts bridge, and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Even if you don't know JavaScript and have no intention of learning it I
  highly recommend you download the app and try the example scripts - and don't
  forget to check out the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.automators.fm/c/ios/scriptable&quot;
    &gt;Scriptable category in the forums&lt;/a
  &gt;
  for more example scripts too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Thank you very much to Simon for coming on the show, and thank you to Omni
  Group - makers of OmniFocus - for sponsoring it!

  said in the episode, one of the keys to success is good naming and structure -
  and I made a screencast which shows you how you can use Keyboard Maestro to
  rename files in a specific format that we need for our project slides at work
  - with incrementing numbers in the &lt;em&gt;middle&lt;/em&gt; of the document name.

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/using-keyboard-maestro-to-create-an-always-up-to-date-task-calendar-from-my-omnifocus/">&lt;p&gt;
  OmniFocus 2 had a calendar you could subscribe to, which gave you a calendar
  view of your tasks. Unfortunately just because of internet connections and
  syncing times which was always a little flakey (completed tasks would hang
  around for a while) and didn't have all of the options I wanted. Unfortunately
  very few people used this service so it was discontinued in OmniFocus 3 - but
  I have an alternative!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Someone in the OmniFocus Slack pointed me to
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/applescript-for-syncing-of-tasks-to-apple-calendar/32054/3?u=rosemaryjayne&quot;
    &gt;this post&lt;/a
  &gt;
  in the OmniFocus forums to help you create calendar events from your OF
  database and I got stuck in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The first thing I decided was that OmniFocus should have its own calendar,
  this made life much easier later so I highly recommend you do this too. The
  next step was to decide how long events should be input for if they have no
  estimated time. The old built in option used an hour which I found too long so
  I set mine to 30 minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I am using Keyboard Maestro to run this script hourly, but to prevent
  duplicate events showing up it makes sense to delete the existing events
  first. There's no finesse here, if it's in this calendar it gets deleted -
  this is where having a dedicated calendar makes life easier, you
  &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; write AppleScript to just delete specific calendar events, or
  even to track which tasks in OmniFocus have been created or edited since the
  script last ran - but I was aiming for the simplest and fastest solution here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the code itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;property calendar_name : &quot;OmniFocus&quot; -- This is the name of your calendar
property default_duration : 30 --minutes

-- Rosemary Orchard
-- Modified from a script by unlocked2412
-- This creates calendar events for tasks which have a due date, if an estimated time is not set then the task defaults to 30 minutes in length

tell application &quot;Calendar&quot;
   set calendar_element to calendar calendar_name
 tell calendar calendar_name
        set theEvents to every event
       repeat with current_event in theEvents
         delete current_event
       end repeat
 end tell
end tell

tell application &quot;OmniFocus&quot;
  tell default document
      set task_elements to flattened tasks whose ¬¨
           (completed is false) and (due date ‚â† missing value)
        repeat with item_ref in task_elements
          -- GET OMNIFOCUS TASKS
         set the_task to contents of item_ref
           set task_name to name of the_task
          set task_note to note of the_task
          set task_due to due date of the_task
           set task_estimate to estimated minutes of the_task
         set task_url to &quot;omnifocus:///task/&quot; &amp;amp; id of the_task
          if task_estimate is missing value then set task_estimate to default_duration
           -- BUILD CALENDAR DATE
         set end_date to task_due
           set start_date to start_date - (task_estimate * minutes)
           -- CREATE CALENDAR EVENT
           tell application &quot;Calendar&quot;
                tell calendar_element
                  if not (exists (first event whose (start date = start_date) and (summary = task_name))) then
                       make new event with properties ¬¨
                           {summary:task_name, start date:start_date, end date:end_date, url:task_url} at calendar_element
                    end if
             end tell
           end tell
       end repeat
 end tell
end tell
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  To summarise: Every incomplete task with a due date is added to the calendar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The name of the task becomes the name of the event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The task note becomes the event note&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    If the task has an estimated duration this is used, otherwise the event is
    set to whatever the default_duration property is at the top of the list (30
    minutes in this example)
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The due date and the duration of the event are used to calculate the start
    date
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The URL of the event is set to be a URL back to the task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    alt=&quot;Graphical view of the Keyboard Maestro Macro&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I don't use the calendar much myself (preferring Fantastical) so I also have
  Keyboard Maestro quit the calendar afterwards for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This Macro uses the cron timer in Keyboard Maestro to run hourly, I've added
  it to a specific group so it only runs on one of my Macs too. When you
  download it you will need to enable it, first make sure you create an
  OmniFocus calendar though, and if you give this calendar a different name then
  you'll need to update the Macro too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This approach has several advantages over the original OmniFocus
  implementation:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can sync this calendar, and store it in whichever service I like.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can control the default length of events.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I could choose to exclude certain events if I wished to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    It could be a jumping off point for other scripts - such as a calendar of
    events you have completed if you wanted one of those.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You could of course use other approaches to run the script automatically, or
  run it manually when you want to, it's entirely up to you!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The script can be downloaded

		<summary type="html">OmniFocus 2 had a calendar you could subscribe to, which gave you a calendar view of your tasks. Unfortunately just because of internet connections and syncing times which was always a little flakey (completed tasks would hang around for a while) and didn't have all of the options I wanted. Unfortunately very few people used this service so it was discontinued in OmniFocus 3 - but I have an alternative! Someone in the OmniFocus Slack pointed me to this post in the OmniFocus forums to help you create calendar events from your OF database and I got stuck in. The first thing I decided was that OmniFocus should have its own calendar, this made life much easier later so I highly recommend you do this too. The next step was to decide how long events should be input for if they have no estimated time. The old built in option used an hour which I found too long so I set mine to 30 minutes. I am using Keyboard Maestro to run this script hourly, but to prevent duplicate events showing up it makes sense to delete the existing events first. There's no finesse here, if it's in this calendar it gets deleted - this is where having a dedicated calendar makes life easier, you could write AppleScript to just delete specific calendar events, or even to track which tasks in OmniFocus have been created or edited since the script last ran - but I was aiming for the simplest and fastest solution here. On to the code itself property calendar_name : &quot;OmniFocus&quot; -- This is the name of your calendar property default_duration : 30 --minutes -- Rosemary Orchard -- Modified from a script by unlocked2412 -- This creates calendar events for tasks which have a due date, if an estimated time is not set then the task defaults to 30 minutes in length tell application &quot;Calendar&quot; set calendar_element to calendar calendar_name tell calendar calendar_name set theEvents to every event repeat with current_event in theEvents delete current_event end repeat end tell end tell tell application &quot;OmniFocus&quot; tell default document set task_elements to flattened tasks whose ¬¨ (completed is false) and (due date ‚â† missing value) repeat with item_ref in task_elements -- GET OMNIFOCUS TASKS set the_task to contents of item_ref set task_name to name of the_task set task_note to note of the_task set task_due to due date of the_task set task_estimate to estimated minutes of the_task set task_url to &quot;omnifocus:///task/&quot; &amp;amp; id of the_task if task_estimate is missing value then set task_estimate to default_duration -- BUILD CALENDAR DATE set end_date to task_due set start_date to start_date - (task_estimate * minutes) -- CREATE CALENDAR EVENT tell application &quot;Calendar&quot; tell calendar_element if not (exists (first event whose (start date = start_date) and (summary = task_name))) then make new event with properties ¬¨ {summary:task_name, start date:start_date, end date:end_date, url:task_url} at calendar_element end if end tell end tell end repeat end tell end tell To summarise: Every incomplete task with a due date is added to the calendar. The name of the task becomes the name of the event. The task note becomes the event note If the task has an estimated duration this is used, otherwise the event is set to whatever the default_duration property is at the top of the list (30 minutes in this example) The due date and the duration of the event are used to calculate the start date The URL of the event is set to be a URL back to the task I don't use the calendar much myself (preferring Fantastical) so I also have Keyboard Maestro quit the calendar afterwards for me.

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/overcast-5-0-review/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/overcast-5-0-review/overcast.png){.image-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/09/overcast.png&quot; width=&quot;172&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This year I was fortunate enough to get onto the Overcast TestFlight this year and wow, Marco is using those watchOS features that everyone got excited about at WWDC!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;¬†Standalone Watch Playback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought I would use my watch to play music or podcasts without my iPhone, but I've recently discovered that our apartment is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; long enough that my headphones or watch are out of range of my iPhone when I'm at one end at it's at the other. I put some music on my watch and paired my Bose QC35s, and then immediately wished I had podcasts on there. The standalone watch playback in Overcast is great. Sync can be a little fiddly due to watchOS limitations, and I had the best success by putting Overcast in my dock on my watch, opening it, putting it and my iPhone on charge and leaving them to it - and now I'm by the pool listening to podcasts on my watch with my iPhone back in my hotel room!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/09/overcast-apple-watch.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1443&quot; height=&quot;773&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Now Playing Screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Now Playing Screen in Overcast has been revamped to use a cards style, with show notes and chapters being split onto separate screens - this is going to be useful as then I will be able to see which chapter I'm currently listening to but still preserve my place in the show notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/overcast-5-0-review/overcast-cards.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/09/overcast-cards.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shortcuts Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I was excited about getting into the beta, and I was not disappointed! Here's a quick list of shortcuts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous Podcast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next Podcast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek Back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek Foward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Speed To 1X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on Smart Speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn Off Smart Speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on Voice Boost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn Off Voice Boost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play All Episodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play All Podcasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play Favourites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other shortcuts will also be present based on the playlists you have, and podcasts you listen to as well. For those you may have to play the playlist or podcast to have them appear as options. You can use these shortcuts either in the Shortcuts app, or by adding them to Siri in either the Overcast App under 'Siri Shortcuts', or in &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Siri &amp;amp; Search &amp;gt; All Shortcuts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search is another new feature in Overcast 5, there's a search bar at the top of each podcast's page which lets you search through the episodes for it, and on the main page of the app where you can see all of your podcasts - which lets you search for episodes or podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcast 5 requires watchOS 5 and iOS 12.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      width=&quot;226&quot;
      height=&quot;226&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
  &gt;Some time ago on Twitter I stumbled across Simon, he was retweeted by the
  developer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://workingcopyapp.com&quot;&gt;Working Copy&lt;/a&gt;, an app I
  love and use heavily - and the retweet was a video of a script being run on an
  iPhone and returning some pretty cool results - so I asked &quot;what is this and
  how can I get a copy?&quot;. Not too long later I was invited to the beta of
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://scriptable.app&quot;&gt;Scriptable&lt;/a&gt;, and got stuck in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Scriptable is an iOS 12 app, and has integration with Siri Shortcuts to help
  you automate to the max. Simon has integrated a huge number of iOS APIs - so
  you can get your current location, communicate directly with the calendar, and
  more. The app also uses native UI elements too - so if you write a script that
  shows an alert the JavaScript you write calls the native alert box.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  So, what can you do with this app? The built in examples include getting the
  current Slack status, grabbing the latest XKCD comic, and viewing shared JSON
  in a readable format. There are many more sample scripts over on the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.automators.fm/c/ios/scriptable?u=rosemaryorchard&quot;
    &gt;Automators Forums&lt;/a
  &gt;
  where I host a community run forum for the app (what better home than with
  Automators?).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/scriptable-javascript-control-your-iphone/scriptable-script-settings.jpeg&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      class=&quot;aligncenter&quot;
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/09/scriptable-script-settings.jpeg&quot;
      width=&quot;300&quot;
      height=&quot;789&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can also trigger Scriptable scripts in any number of ways. When you tap
  the settings icon inside of a script you get the option to immediately add the
  script to Siri, you can copy the URL scheme to the app, and even add it
  directly to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id532016360?at=1010lumu&quot;
    &gt;Launch Center Pro&lt;/a
  &gt;
  which will then let you trigger notifications to run it at specific times or
  places.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  All of your scripts are donated to Siri too, which means they're available in
  the Shortcuts app as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

      height=&quot;433&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can get
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1405459188?at=1010lumu&quot;
    &gt;Scriptable&lt;/a
  &gt;
  on the App Store now - and it's free which is insane, so please make use of
  the tip jar!

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/wave-goodbye-to-workflow-say-hello-to-shortcuts/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/09/workflow-to-shortcuts.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's iOS 12 release day and the time has come to do something many people feared as long ago as March 2017 - it's time to say goodbye to Workflow. I'm extremely happy to have had Workflow - and what's more I'm happy to say goodbye to it because today Shortcuts launches and we have nearly everything that was in Workflow - and a way for app developers to hook straight into the app and the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are we losing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question was what came to my mind at WWDC, I try not to be negative but a concern for many of us Workflow and automation nerds was &quot;what won't work anymore?&quot;. Thankfully there are only a few things which we have truly lost:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File manipulation in Box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triggering IFTTT Applets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post to Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save to Transmit (as the app is no longer on the iOS App Store it's not a surprise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post to Tumblr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit Image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send via DeskConnect (also unsurprising - the service was shut down long ago).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only one of these that really causes difficulties is the edit image action, while you can still crop images and various other actions you can no longer do so in an interactive manner as part of a Shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What have we gained?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have gained a lot in Shortcuts, here's a list of actions which to my knowledge didn't exist in Workflow but are part of Shortcuts - but aren't donated to Siri by an app developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add to Draft (Drafts 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Contents of Draft (Drafts 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Draft (Drafts 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run Drafts Action (Drafts 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request Payment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run Javascript on Web Page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send Payment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Airplane Mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Bluetooth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Cellular Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Do Not Disturb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Low Power Mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Wi-Fi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show Result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last action is most interesting to me - it works like an alert if you run a Shortcut from Shortcuts, but will display the answer in Siri if you call the shortcut from Siri. The dictation action has also had an upgrade - allowing it to stop automatically after a pause, or a short pause, or on a tap (you can choose). This makes Shortcuts much more useful if you're using it via Siri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's still to come?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities here are seemingly endless - I've already seen many of the apps I use daily updating to support Shortcuts, from Waterminder to TripIt, Carrot to Working Copy, and many more. What we get now will be up to the app developers - but they seem to be making the most of it!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/using-tripit-with-siri-shortcuts/">&lt;p&gt;I was most pleasantly surprised today to see an update to the TripIt app which added support for Siri Shortcuts. They've kept it quite simple, with just two options: upcoming flight information, and upcoming travel plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/using-tripit-with-siri-shortcuts/tripit-shortcut-options.png&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/using-tripit-with-siri-shortcuts/tripit-shortcut-options.png&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upcoming flight information is especially helpful telling you how long you have before your flight, and the flight number as well as the airline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/using-tripit-with-siri-shortcuts/upcoming-flight-example.png&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/using-tripit-with-siri-shortcuts/upcoming-flight-example.png&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upcoming travel plans works in much the same way providing useful details. There is a nice touch if you don't have any upcoming travel plans though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/using-tripit-with-siri-shortcuts/no-upcoming-plans.jpeg&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/using-tripit-with-siri-shortcuts/no-upcoming-plans.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very pleased to see apps that aren't for nerds updating with this sort of thing - that's what is needed to help Shortcuts become truly useful for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/drafts-5-4</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/drafts-5-4/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1236254471?at=1010lumu&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot;&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; Drafts 5.4 is here today, and while it feels like it was just yesterday when it was released Greg has found numerous ways to improve things! Here's a quick overview of all the features added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Shortcuts Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shortcuts Action in Drafts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of Shortcuts and it replacing Workflow we've got a fair few actions to update - thankfully the Shortcuts actions work the same way as Workflow ones did, so you can easily replace them. If you have an older device which Shortcuts doesn't support but Drafts does then you can keep using Workflow though. There's documentation on &lt;a href=&quot;http://getdrafts.com/actions/steps/runshortcut&quot;&gt;running Shortcuts in Drafts&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy this is getting confusing! In iOS 12 every app has the option of telling Siri what you've been doing (stored locally on your device for privacy and security reasons), and these can then be suggested to you. This also means we can use these in the Shortcuts app as part of a longer chain of things - or individually (best set up via &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Siri &amp;amp; Search&lt;/code&gt; to avoid cluttering your Shortcuts app with potentially hundreds of one action automations!), via Siri or through typing in the search. We can use these to capture the clipboard, launch dictation, or view a specific draft which is ideal for reference material. Inside of Drafts you can add specific Drafts to Siri, and to add a Workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Separators in Action Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now add separators in action groups - these are what they sound like, little dividers which help you split up your actions. It's a small visual indication, but a big help when you have a longer list of actions - or many which are similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don't Sleep While Working&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a script step you can now tell your device you don't want it to autosleep using &lt;code&gt;app.isIdleDisabled&lt;/code&gt; - I've built this into some of my blogging actions so when I start a new post my device remains awake but when I publish it goes back to normal :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dropbox API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing Shortcuts no longer does is integration with Dropbox, thankfully Drafts has come to my rescue by adding the Dropbox API! Details in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://reference.getdrafts.com/objects/Dropbox.html&quot;&gt;Scripting Reference&lt;/a&gt;. Look for ready to use example actions, like &quot;Create on Dropbox Paper&quot; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://actions.getdrafts.com&quot;&gt;Action Directory&lt;/a&gt;. I've created several actions which save files in multiple formats to specific directories in Dropbox and copy the folder URL back to my clipboard which is great for when I'm working on things things I am sharing with others! This alone makes Drafts worth the subscription price for me :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wordpress Integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't think anything would make me consider going back to Wordpress, but this nearly did! Drafts now has native integration which is quite simply wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google Drive Enhancements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now create fully styled documents and PDFs through the Upload option when combined with the HTML Preview actions - and much more. Text uploads also support appending or prepending, and you can also upload Markdown and HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a nice new light grey theme which I'm using for &quot;bright sunlight&quot; days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can easily copy the UUID or the text of a Draft to the clipboard through the &lt;code&gt;‚ìò&lt;/code&gt; button, as well as a link to a Draft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of tweaks for better performance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the full, official, release notes &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-5-4-released-ios-12-ready-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/2493?u=rosemaryorchard&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course backing up your device is a good idea, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to do a separate backup of your Workflows or Shortcuts that you've created - and maybe it's time to clear out your collection and start afresh (speaking as someone with over 800 Shortcuts, it's definitely time!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've created both Workflows and Shortcuts to do this for you, the Shortcuts shortcut is designed to be run on each of your devices - while iCloud Sync &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be working now, some of us with extremely large libraries have had the syncing get a little stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially all this does is grab all of your Workflows and create a zip of them in iCloud Drive, the date and time you run the automation is included in the file name, and the Shortcuts variation also includes your device name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backups are good, and even if everything goes perfectly on Monday, which I'm sure they will, you won't regret it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep on automating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/macsparky-learn-siri-shortcuts-course/siri-shortcuts-course-artwork.png&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/macsparky-learn-siri-shortcuts-course/siri-shortcuts-course-artwork.png&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course includes 40 videos which total over 3 hours of material to watch, and loads of Shortcuts you can download directly. The guide is available for $24 right now, but will be going up to $29 shortly after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love about this course is it doesn't matter if you don't know anything about Siri Shortcuts or Workflow, or if you're a grand master - you can still learn something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can sign up for the course over at David's new learning website, and while you're there you should pick up his &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.macsparky.com/p/workflow&quot;&gt;free Workflow guide&lt;/a&gt; too - &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.macsparky.com/p/siri&quot;&gt;learn.macsparky.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/apple-keynote-september-2018/">&lt;p&gt;I, like many of you I'm sure, watched last night's Keynote waiting to see what new products Apple will sell me. I went into the event thinking I wanted a new Apple Watch and that I wouldn't upgrade my 256GB iPhone X, and thankfully for my bank account came out of the event the same!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple Watch has several new features will encourage members of my family to upgrade as well as myself. I bought my grandmother an Apple Watch after she had a nasty fall a few years ago and shattered her hip - my thinking was the SOS function would be useful for her, but now I would very much appreciate it if she had the automatic fall detection too. The low heart rate detection and ECG feature will be very handy for my father has there are hereditary heart problems in his family, plus he complains that the screen is too small so more screen will definitely go down well there. I'm very pleased that all the watch bands I've collected so far will continue to fit as well - I do like to co-ordinate the straps with my outfit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone updates look pretty nice too, though I'm most intrigued by the NFC update which will allow apps to be triggered through NFC - as Tim Chaten said to me on Twitter this seems like it could be a big win for automation:&lt;/p&gt;

	  <published>2018-08-31T20:00:00+01:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-5-project-templates</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-5-project-templates/">&lt;p&gt;
  Episode 5 of Automators is all about project templates, and how they can help
  you to be more productive. David and I are both OmniFocus users, but project
  templates can be used with almost every task management system out there -
  even Reminders!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  The simplest type of project template is a project you can copy - this is
  easily done in both OmniFocus and Things, the advantage is it's easy to set
  up, but it's also static - what you have is what you get.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can also store project templates somewhere else, the places I have used
  are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Editorial&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iCloud Drive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dropbox&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drafts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workflow/Shortcuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One thing I have done is to import all of the templates I'd previously saved
  into Dropbox and iCloud Drive into Drafts - this was easily done by pressing
  and holding the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; icon which then lets you import a file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Something I use a lot when making templates for OmniFocus is TaskPaper - and I
  even made a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1F6&quot;&gt;Drafts Action Group&lt;/a&gt; to help
  me do so easily. What you can do with OmniFocus and TaskPaper is create a
  template in OmniFocus, copy it and then paste it into a text editor (like
  Drafts) to edit it - this allows you to put &quot;fuzzy dates&quot; in, such as
  &quot;Thursday&quot; or &quot;Monday -2d&quot;, the latter evaluating to two days before Monday.
  You can also include &lt;code&gt;¬´variables¬ª&lt;/code&gt; which the TaskPaper to OF action
  will then help you replace.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I demonstrated how to use this action group in a screencast for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/xit6JLmbnZY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And there's also a blog post all about it:
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.rosemaryorchard.com/blog/using-drafts-5-taskpaper-with-omnifocus&quot;
    &gt;Using Drafts 5 Taskpaper with OmniFocus&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As I mentioned in the podcast, Todoist supports importing a CSV file - and if
  your task manager does too then you can use Numbers or Excel and date math to
  make relative dates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what kind of project templates might you create?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Packing Lists&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Publishing a podcast episode&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing and submitting an essay/report&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  While David and I are both primarily OmniFocus users, there are also lots of
  great resources for Things users:

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And the Todoist blog also has a post called
  &lt;a

    &gt;A whole new way to create and share Todoist Templates - Todoist Blog&lt;/a
  &gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One of the workflows/Shortcuts I mentioned on the podcast was one to create an
  essay project, the options here are somewhat simplified, but demonstrate quite
  nicely how this works:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/b26737b265064cfcbe1e7ff96bef7189&quot;
      &gt;Essay to OmniFocus&lt;/a
    &gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/22bd0892decf40a9a9b10aebf5a84701&quot;
      &gt;Essay to OmniFocus&lt;/a
    &gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    As the URL Scheme in Things doesn't support adding headings I formatted the
    project in Things somewhat differently - however you can import a JSON which
    does support headings format so if you're willing to get stuck in I'm sure
    you can figure it out!
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Another Workflow/Shortcut I mentioned is the iOS implementation of these
  scripts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://curtclifton.net/poptemp&quot;

    &gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lemonmade/templates&quot;
      &gt;Chris Suave: Templates Applescript for OmniFocus.&lt;/a
    &gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    What they allow you to do is to store a project in OmniFocus and then run
    AppleScript, which will parse out &lt;code&gt;¬´variables¬ª&lt;/code&gt; and create a new
    project, with the help of the share sheet and two Workflows I recreated this
    functionality and wrote about it on Colter Reed's blog:
    &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://colterreed.com/how-to-fill-out-omnifocus-project-templates-with-workflow/&quot;
      &gt;How to Fill Out OmniFocus Project Templates with Workflow | Colter
      Reed&lt;/a
    &gt;. What is probably interesting for you is that this is not one Workflow but
    two, and the second one is recursive - that is it calls itself until a
    condition is met, for this workflow that there are not more variables to
    parse. Using Workflows/Shortcuts as a function is something I rarely see but
    is extremely useful.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  David also did a great screencast about how he uses Shortcuts to make project
  templates:&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/6FMS4c3S9p8&quot;&gt;plugin:youtube&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Make sure to check out the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://relay.fm/automators/5&quot;&gt;show notes&lt;/a&gt; for all of the links,
  and I look forward to discussing this episode and all of your examples for
  project templates &lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.automators.fm&quot;&gt;in the forums&lt;/a&gt;!

  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-upload-blog-post-via-ssh/workflow-upload-blog-post.png&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      class=&quot;alignright&quot;
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/workflow-upload-blog-post.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
  &gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://getgrav.org&quot;&gt;Grav&lt;/a&gt; as my blog CMS, it's powerful
  and customisable, and it lets me upload blog posts via (S)FTP. The catch? My
  previous system for blogging involved using
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://panic.com/transmit/&quot;&gt;Transmit&lt;/a&gt; and Workflow - and sadly
  Transmit for iOS
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://panic.com/blog/the-future-of-transmit-ios/&quot;&gt;is no more&lt;/a&gt;.
  (You may be wondering why I'm only changing my system now, instead of back in
  January when Panic stopped working on Transmit for iOS. It's simple, it was
  still supported in Workflow, sadly it is no longer supported in Shortcuts.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  This Workflow takes advantage of the &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; input option for the
  Run Script Over SSH action, in simple terms it means that you can give this
  action input as well as using variables as input in the script section.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  A quick lesson on how Grav works for those unfamiliar with it and looking to
  modify this for Jekyll or another CMS:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    There is a User folder where the data for your site is stored (config files,
    pages, etc.)
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Inside of this folder is the Pages folder, where your pages are stored.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Folders inside of this become slugs the URL, so my blog posts are all in
    &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The file name is the name of the twig template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  To start with I choose where I want to store the post, if it's a link to a
  guest post it goes in one folder, and a blog post goes in another - this is
  just my personal preference. I'm using a dictionary to do this because then I
  can see one option, but have it output something different - as my blog is the
  second item in my menu I would have to choose &lt;code&gt;02.blog&lt;/code&gt; every time
  otherwise. The next step is asking for the slug - this is nearly always on my
  clipboard (because I run this from Drafts and Drafts puts the slug on my
  clipboard!), then I get the text that was shared to the Workflow and Run
  Script Over SSH - which is where all the magic happens. The workflow I've
  shared does the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd user/pages/$Chosen_Location;
mkdir $Slug;
cd $Slug;
cat &amp;gt; blogpost.md;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I've used the dollar signs here to represent Workflow variables - the key line
  is the last one, where I save the input of the SSH action to the file
  &lt;code&gt;blogpost.md&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot;
      &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/Scripting.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt;: This is a list of the folders where I might choose
    to save a blog post.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot;
      &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/Scripting.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt;: I choose one of those folders
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot;
      &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/Scripting.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;: And grab the slug for the post.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot;
      &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/Variable.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;Set Variable&lt;/code&gt;: I save the slug to a variable
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot;
      &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/Variable.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Variable&lt;/code&gt;: And then I get the blog post shared to the
    Workflow.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot;
      &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/Scripting.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;Run Script Over SSH&lt;/code&gt;: Finally I run the SSH script.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now, I actually save my blog posts in numbered folders - Grav will drop the
  number and dot at the start of the a folder name and use the rest of it as a
  slug, this helps me find posts based on when they were published from a folder
  list. If I create the post in the Grav admin GUI then it numbers them
  automatically, but it is possible to do this on the command line too! The
  script I use is as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd user/pages/$Correct_Location;
filecount=$(ls | wc -l);
mkdir ${filecount}.$Slug;
cd ${filecount}.$Slug;
cat &amp;gt; blogpost.md;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  What this does is it counts the files and folders in the current folder and
  saves them to a variable on command line called &lt;code&gt;filecount&lt;/code&gt; - and
  then I use this to create the folder for me. This variable is only valid for
  this session - but that's fine for what we need. The folder where the post
  will be published contains a file which will display the list of blog posts
  and this gives me the +1 I need to create the next folder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this script is of use to at least one person!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can get the workflow here:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/7ed756f77d1c47b19d28c445a4857b47&quot;

Action groups are flexible because they can be turned into projects if necessary, or be a series of tasks within a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workflow works by asking you for the main task, then it asks for the sub tasks. Each sub task is indented (and has a dash added in front of the name to make it TaskPaper friendly), and then the whole lot is put into my OmniFocus inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exact Workflow Steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/Scripting.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;: This is the main task.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/Variable.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;code&gt;Add to Variable&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;Task List&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  Episode 4 of automators is all about Shortcuts and Siri Shortcuts. We
  discussed what's possible now, what we're excited about (and not so excited).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I did mention my automation I now use when boarding a plane - this is
  available over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sharecuts.app&quot;&gt;Sharecuts.app&lt;/a&gt; which we
  didn't get into this episode, but it's a great place to share Shortcuts and
  let other people download them!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can listen to episode 4 on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/automators/4&quot;&gt;Relay FM&lt;/a&gt;, and discuss it in
  &lt;a

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-sketch-icon.png50x150){.image-right&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      class=&quot;alignright&quot;
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-sketch-icon.png&quot;
      width=&quot;118&quot;
      height=&quot;118&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
  &gt;I am once again lucky enough to be in the early preview for OmniFocus 3 -
  this time on the Mac! What's important to keep in mind here is that this is a
  beta, and an early one at that - things can and likely will change between me
  writing this post and OmniFocus 3 for Mac being released - they may have
  already changed by the time you read this post!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This is a beta app so there's no guarantees, for me the app has been very
  stable - but I'm also running it on High Sierra. However as the builds can
  literally be released every few hours (depending on what is being added or
  changed) this could change at the drop of a hat - so be warned üòâ.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Icon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We have the sketch icon again! It's cute, and helpful to distinguish between
  the two apps in your dock. Personally I put OmniFocus 2 in a folder in
  Applications called &quot;OmniFocus 2&quot; and the beta in a folder called &quot;OmniFocus
  3&quot; (yes, I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; feeling creative, however did you guess‚ÄΩ). This means
  if you launch the app via spotlight you get a helpful text hint about which
  version of the app you're launching too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-spotlight-launcher.png?lightbox=1024x400){.image-center&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-spotlight-launcher.png&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forecast View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Interleaved tasks and calendar events have made their way to the Mac in the
  forecast view. This is really handy for putting my day together and I'm a big
  fan of this on iOS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-forecast-view.png?lightbox=1024x400&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-3-forecast-view.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
  &gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-2-forecast-view.png?lightbox=1024x400&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-2-forecast-view.png&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I find this view much more beneficial than the gantt style view in OmniFocus
  2, just because it brings everything together.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Appearance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  OmniFocus looks different now, for example the toolbar across the top is much
  slimmer and by default includes fewer actions - though as always you can
  customise it by right clicking on it to add more options. The sidebar where
  the perspectives (and any starred custom perspectives) are listed, as well as
  the area where the project or tag list is shown have a dark background too,
  which I find helps me focus on the tasks area - the important things!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-project-view.png?lightbox=1024x400&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-3-project-view.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
  &gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-2-project-view.png?lightbox=1024x400&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-2-project-view.png&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One place where you can see some subtle, but effective changes to the design
  is in the inspector. For example the status of the selected item has changed
  from a dropdown to segmented controls - the iOS equivalent of radio buttons
  (you have probably seen these in the maps app, to say that you want to see a
  map, transit, or satellite view). Tags of course have changed too, so that you
  could see multiple tags which are assigned to the current item at the same
  time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-task-inspector.png?lightbox=1024x400&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-3-task-inspector.png&quot;
    /&gt; &lt;/a
  &gt;&lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-2-task-inspector.png?lightbox=1024x400&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-2-task-inspector.png&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Repeats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In OmniFocus 3 for iOS we got custom repeats, and these have been brought over
  to the Mac as well. The place where this really shows is in the monthly where
  you can specify that a task should repeat on day &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; of the month,
  or you can specify a repeat on the &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;th &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;day of each
  month (e.g. the second Tuesday). These repeats have come in very handy for me
  - for example I submit my timesheet for last month on the first Monday of the
  next month.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-mac-sneak-peek/omnifocus-3-monthly-repeats-days-month.png?lightbox=1024x400&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-3-monthly-repeats-days-month.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/omnifocus-3-monthly-repeats-days-week.png&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Custom Perspectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Another feature we're now seeing on the Mac is enhanced custom perspectives.
  You can build these by nesting rules - if you've used Hazel or created smart
  folders in Finder then you'll be familiar with creating the rules (click the
  &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; to add a new one), and you can press &lt;code&gt;ALT&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code
    &gt;+&lt;/code
  &gt;
  to add a nested rule. A new feature here that's not yet on iOS is the ability
  to change the overarching rule, on iOS it defaults to &quot;all of&quot;, and this can
  be changed to &quot;any of&quot; or &quot;none of&quot; in the new Mac version - though at the
  time of writing this doesn't yet sync to iOS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'm very excited about the new OmniFocus 3 for Mac, and really looking forward
  to seeing how it evolves throughout the beta process!

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/workflow-markdown-to-nice-pdf/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-markdown-to-nice-pdf/workflow-markdown-to-nice-pdf.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/workflow-markdown-to-nice-pdf.png&quot; width=&quot;139&quot; height=&quot;139&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Every so often I want to make a nice PDF from some text which is currently formatted in Markdown and I often do this by sharing the text to Workflow. Unfortunately by default when you make rich text from markdown in Workflow you end up with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-markdown-to-nice-pdf/example-without-formatting.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/example-without-formatting.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;647&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's Times New Roman. Not a font I usually use by choice. Thankfully however it's quite simple to fix this with my Workflow. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, I convert the rich text to HTML, replace the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag with one containing a HTML inline style (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), make rich text from that HTML, and then make the PDF. The body in HTML is where all of your content is, so this will then apply to all of your text. If you just wanted to change the first level of headings, you could replace the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-markdown-to-nice-pdf/example-with-formatting.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/example-with-formatting.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;647&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how the whole Workflow runs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/RichText.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/RichText.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;code&gt;Make Rich Text from Markdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/RichText.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/RichText.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;code&gt;Make HTML from Rich Text&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/Text.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;code&gt;Replace Text&lt;/code&gt;, this is where I replace the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/RichText.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/RichText.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;code&gt;Make Rich Text from HTML&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/PDF.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/PDF.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;code&gt;Make PDF&lt;/code&gt;, make sure that &lt;code&gt;include margin&lt;/code&gt; is enabled otherwise the PDF looks funny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: The PDF contains the text as well, so it's searchable and also accessible. All you need to do is to add an action at the end of the Workflow to make it do what you want with it, you could quick look it, share it, open it in another application or save it somewhere you choose!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the simplest workflow here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/0f438f7dc4c34b43a3aa02fb108b08d3&quot;&gt;Markdown To Nice PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also be possible to link a style sheet, such as the [Pure CSS] one, by adding the css link to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, the caveat of this is most pre-built CSS files work best when you add classes to sections (e.g. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; would be &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table class=&quot;pure-table&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), which will require many more &lt;code&gt;Replace Text&lt;/code&gt; actions if you want to account for all the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/772806a60f4a4b968f273aa0f0c3eca3&quot;&gt;Pure CSS version&lt;/a&gt; is also available.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-episode-3-sal-soghoian-applescript-numbers-keynote/">&lt;p&gt;
  In the third episode of Automators we are joined by Sal Soghoian, AppleScript
  God, to learn about AppleScript and how to use it!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  While David and I usually take it in turns to write up everything about the
  show and provide complete documentation, Sal's actually done that for this
  week:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;alignnone size-medium&quot;
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/08/macos_automation_automators.png&quot;
    width=&quot;1686&quot;
    height=&quot;4247&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can find the scripts, videos, and a complete breakdown of everything over
  at &lt;a href=&quot;http://macosautomation.com/automators/&quot;&gt;macOSautomation&lt;/a&gt;, along
  with all of Sal's other things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In this show Sal gave us 3 AppleScripts. The first takes a whole table, and
  converts it into a bar chart in Keynote, the second takes a row or column and
  makes a pie chart, and the final one takes selected rows and turns them into a
  chart.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Q1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Q2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Q3&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Q4&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Widget A&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1212&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1495&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1170&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1423&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Widget B&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1902&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$2345&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1835&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$2121&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Widget C&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$2636&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$3250&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$2542&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$3168&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brilliance of this, is the first script is just 17 lines - that's it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img

	  <title type="html">Useful iMessage Apps</title>
	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/useful-imessage-apps/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Useful iMessage Apps" />
	  <published>2018-07-16T08:00:00+01:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/useful-imessage-apps</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/useful-imessage-apps/">&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked on Twitter which iMessage apps I use regularly, and thought it might well be worth a blog post - there are some really &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; iMessage apps out there, but most people just seem to use stickers! (Not that stickers aren't great of course.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Airmail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever wanted or needed to send an email attachment via iMessage this is an easy way to do it. You simply get a list of attachments on emails, allowing you to send the file onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Citymapper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular app is very useful - you can send your current location, a recently searched for destination, or your current trip. Very useful if you're trying to meet up with people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/useful-imessage-apps/citymapper.jpg){.image-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/citymapper.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Copied&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Copied, it's a great clipboard manager that syncs between iOS and macOS, and you have access to images in it iMessage app. I often share to Copied and then I can use either the keyboard or the iMessage app to share things on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doodle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever tried to arrange an event that involves more than one person you've done the back and forth of &quot;are you free then? No, how about next week? FIne, I give up&quot; (or similar), Doodle is fabulous to help you fix that - you just create a poll when &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are available, and everyone votes for the dates that work for them. Well throw that into a group iMessage and you've saved yourself 100 notifications (more or less, depending on the size of the group and how busy their schedules are!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drafts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often start my writing in Drafts, regardless of what it is, and now I can grab a Draft and send it via iMessage. It's very useful and helps you avoid that copy and paste dance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to send a file that's stored in Dropbox this is the easiest way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Glympse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love sharing my location with people to help us find one another, Glympse goes a few steps above Find Friends here. You can choose to share for a time period, or until you get a location - if you do that it calculates the route and shows the person where you are on your route, how fast you're moving, and your estimated arrival time. Being able to share it via iMessage is extremely useful, especially as the other person doesn't need to be using Glympse check on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mapstr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapstr is one of my favourite apps, I bookmark locations in it all the time, and I frequently want to share them! With the iMessage app you can search for a location - sorted by nearest to you automatically. The shared item results in a map, with the name and tags you have specified - so the person could import it directly if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/useful-imessage-apps/mapstr_list.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/mapstr_list.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/useful-imessage-apps/mapstr-demo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/mapstr-demo.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to share music with people, they probably heard about it months, years, or decades before I came across it, but it's fun nonetheless. With the iMessage app I can send the exact track I'm listening to right now to a friend - or pick something earlier from my playing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/useful-imessage-apps/music-imessage-app.jpeg){.image-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/music-imessage-app.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;OneDrive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works the same way the Dropbox app does, but with OneDrive (funny that). It's pretty useful for Word documents I've had to wrangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TripIt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I travel, a lot. At least compared to some people. I love to use TripIt to share parts of my trip with people. It formats things prettily, while still giving them the information they would want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/useful-imessage-apps/tripit-imessage-app-demo.png){.image-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/tripit-imessage-app-demo.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Week Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually invite people to calendar events if they're involved or affected by it, however sometimes that's not practical. It's nice to be able to share the details of an event though. What's great about this app is it shares both the text (name of the event, start date/time, end date/time), and it also shares a URL, from the URL the person can add an ICS file straight to their calendar of the exact event if they like, or use iOS's smart recogniition to add their own event from the dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/useful-imessage-apps/weekcalendar-choose-an-event.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/weekcalendar-choose-an-event.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/useful-imessage-apps/weekcalendar-share-an-event.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/weekcalendar-share-an-event.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/useful-imessage-apps/week-calendar-view-an-event.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/week-calendar-view-an-event.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Yelp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't save &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; to Mapstr - so Yelp comes in handy, especially when evaluating options. You can search and choose from recently searched for locations, and share them - by default the preview shows an image with the name and rating overlaid - but with the address underneath, so once you've finally picked the perfect pancake place you can head right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/useful-imessage-apps/yelp-imessage-app.png){.image-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/yelp-imessage-app.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iMessage apps certainly come in handy, which ones are you using?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/sonos-and-airplay-2-first-impressions/">&lt;p&gt;I bought a Sonos One back when it was released late last year, and it quickly became something I used without thinking about it too much. I got a Spotify subscription and liked that I could just switch my stream from my headphones to the Sonos from the Spotify app - in contrast to Apple and Google Music services which required navigating the Sonos app. I prefer Apple Music though - being able to put my headphones on and just press play is a surprisingly powerful factor, so I switched away from Spotify and back to Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airplay 2 has given me the ability to switch where the music is playing to easily once more though, I can switch from my AirPods to my Sonos, there's a very slight pause waiting for the stream to switch - but this is technology, not magic! You can use any app to play the audio elsewhere, though some apps need to update to support Airplay 2 and those are noticeable with a longer pause from when you press a music control button - but I'm confident we'll get an update for these apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently listening to podcasts on my Sonos and it's good - easy, no fiddling, just play and select the audio output. I have a feeling this might cause me to purchase a few more!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-episode-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automators 1: Automating Calendar Events" />
	  <published>2018-07-06T17:30:00+01:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-episode-1/">&lt;p&gt;
  This week's episodes of
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/automators/1&quot;&gt;The Automators&lt;/a&gt; is focused on
  calendar event creation. There are many ways you can automatically create
  calendar events, and it's useful to be able to do so, to avoid losing
  information. You can also use calendar events as a trigger to do something -
  which we cover towards the end. Below there are details of all the automations
  we cover, including 4 (really, four!) screencasts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Workflow: Calendar Event Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;alignright&quot;
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/workflow-calendar-event-templates.png&quot;
    width=&quot;163&quot;
    height=&quot;163&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This is a very simple Workflow which asks me for the date and time of the
  event, and then what kind of event this is (the demo has 3 examples) - it then
  adjusts the time to add an appropriate length for the appointment and adds it
  to my calendar. This is very useful because I can never remember what floor my
  dentist is on or exactly where to turn to find my hairdresser - so I can add
  this to the notes. Even if the places you frequent are not hidden like mine
  are you can still use this!&lt;br /&gt;
  You can get the workflow here:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/434bd4cf625f419282aee780d3414a4c&quot;
    &gt;Calendar Event Templates&lt;/a
  &gt;
  Make sure to read on to find out about the &quot;Run Workflow&quot; action at the end of
  it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Workflow: Add Event To Work Calendar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;alignleft&quot;
    src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/workflow-add-event-to-work-calendar.png&quot;
    width=&quot;143&quot;
    height=&quot;143&quot;
  /&gt;This workflow follows the first one, and is in fact run by it - or could be.
  It simply asks you if the appointment you've made is during working hours, and
  if you say yes, adds an event that starts half an hour before and ends half an
  hour after the appointment you've just created to your calendar. Make sure to
  tweak the calendar setting here! You can get the workflow here:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/7028582e422441209e36690ab4621b94&quot;
    &gt;Add Event To Work Calendar (Menu)&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Of course, you can automate this too, this formats the date of the event as
  one letter (so Monday becomes M, Friday becomes F), and if it's not Saturday
  or Sunday, checks if the event starts after 8 am but before 6pm - if yes it
  adds an event to your calendar. It's not &lt;em&gt;insanely&lt;/em&gt; complicated, but
  it's not as simple as the Workflow above.&lt;br /&gt;
  You can get the workflow here:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/3a0dd365141d4146981c1297148f2a24&quot;
    &gt;Add Event To Work Calendar (Auto)&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;David's Hyper Scheduling Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img

    width=&quot;144&quot;
    height=&quot;144&quot;
  /&gt;Since February David has had an ongoing
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2018/2/the-hyper-scheduling-experiment&quot;
    &gt;Hyper-Scheduling Experiment&lt;/a
  &gt;, which involves scheduling blocks of time in his calendar to provide a
  framework throughout his day. You can see his Workflow to generate some of the
  core blocks here.
&lt;/p&gt;

  You can get the workflow here:

  &gt;Here David walks you through how his Workflow to add travel time events to
  your calendar works.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  You can get the workflow here:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/9bd57fd605034d3bade12d8486b80d7e&quot;
    &gt;Travel Time&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repeating Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Of course, one of the simplest ways to automate calendar event creation is
  repeats - and you can go from very simple up to fairly complex within that.
  The simplest repeats are every day/week/month/year, but if you go into the
  &lt;code&gt;Custom...&lt;/code&gt; options then you can create repeats such as &quot;On the
  first weekday of every month&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/automators-episode-1/calendar-simple-repeat-options.png&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      class=&quot;&quot;
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/calendar-weekly-repeat-options.png&quot;
      width=&quot;441&quot;
      height=&quot;423&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
  &gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/automators-episode-1/calendar-monthly-repeat-options.png&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      class=&quot;&quot;
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/calendar-monthly-repeat-options.png&quot;
      width=&quot;413&quot;
      height=&quot;495&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copy and paste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If repeating events count as automation (they do!) then copying and pasting
  events does as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CMD+D&lt;/code&gt; allows you to duplicate an event, and then you can drag
    and drop it.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CMD+C&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;CMD+V&lt;/code&gt; lets you paste, if you select
    a new date before you paste then the event is automatically added to that
    day. In many apps you can even paste it in at the time you have selected.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Fantastical on iOS gives you the option to duplicate an event when you tap
    and hold on it, or when you swipe, and tap &quot;More...&quot;, BusyCal allows you to
    duplicate an event by force touching it. I personally prefer Fantastical as
    it immediately asks me for the new date where as with BusyCal you need to
    edit the new event.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/automators-episode-1/fantastical-duplicate-event.png&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img

&lt;h2&gt;Workflow: Copy a Calendar Event&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      width=&quot;155&quot;
      height=&quot;155&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
  &gt;This Workflow lets you choose from calendar events, and uses the chosen item
  to create a new event. It is currently set to use events from today, but you
  can easily change the filter in the &quot;Find Calendar Events&quot; action to look in
  the last week, the next week, or any time period of your choice.
&lt;/p&gt;

  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can get the workflow here:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/ac14868356bd40a4b9223bbac1a844df&quot;
    &gt;Copy Calendar Event&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parsing a list of events with Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I first mentioned this automation in
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/mpu/418&quot;&gt;episode 418 of the Mac Power Users&lt;/a&gt;,
  this is designed to help you take a list of events and quickly add them to the
  right calendars. As David mentioned on the podcast you could also use it to
  calculate dates backwards from a specific event (he used a trial as an
  example) to add other events or deadlines to your calendar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/tvlrZpEklbw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxx77d2bblqgt6k/Fantastical%20Calendar%20Event%20Creation.numbers?dl=1&quot;
    &gt;download the spreadsheet here&lt;/a
  &gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The Keyboard Maestro Macro is very simple, it splits the text on your
  clipboard into lines, and then runs the following AppleScript on each line.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot;&gt;tell application &quot;Keyboard Maestro Engine&quot; to set myEvent to getvariable &quot;Event&quot;

tell application &quot;Fantastical 2&quot;
    parse sentence myEvent with add immediately
end tell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This AppleScript merely sets a local variable to the Keyboard Maestro variable
  for the line, and then uses Fantastical's AppleScript support to get it to
  parse the event and add it straight to your calendar. If you wanted to
  evaluate each event before it gets added then you would remove the
  &lt;code&gt;with add immediately&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/automators-episode-1/keyboard-maestro-macro-clipboard-to-fantastical-lines.png){.image-center&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/keyboard-maestro-macro-clipboard-to-fantastical-lines.png&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can download this
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hthy74msa5j1ti/Add-clipboard-events-to-Fantastical.kmmacros?dl=1&quot;
    &gt;Keyboard Maestro Macro here&lt;/a
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    class=&quot;alignright&quot;

    width=&quot;196&quot;
    height=&quot;196&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can also make this system iOS friendly in two ways, the Numbers sheet
  itself of course works on iOS. But you can do two things with the list of
  events it generates, the first is to use a Workflow,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/8be06c81e6f4408687a1a5ca1e8b772d&quot;
    &gt;Clipboard Events To Fantastical&lt;/a
  &gt;
  which goes through all the lines on your clipboard adding them to Fantastical
  for you. The second way is to use Drafts, with the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ED&quot;&gt;Events in Fantastical&lt;/a&gt; action
  provided by Agile Tortoise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As mentioned in the show, David has a great series of
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://flexibits.com/fantastical/videos&quot;
    &gt;video tutorials for Fantastical&lt;/a
  &gt;
  where he guides you through the core features and some of the syntax options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding event with AppleScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As we mentioned in the show, AppleScript is not the most flexible when it
  comes to adding events to your calendar. However it is definitely possible! I
  highly recommend the
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/CalendarScriptingGuide/Calendar-CreateanEvent.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016646-CH94-SW3&quot;
    &gt;official Apple documentation&lt;/a
  &gt;
  as a starting point for a script that &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;, There's also a library
  called
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/apps/Script_Libs.html#CalendarLib_EC&quot;
    &gt;CalendarLib&lt;/a
  &gt;
  which is linked on the very helpful
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://macosautomation.com&quot;&gt;macosautomation.com&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Of course, you can also use AppleScript to control Fantastical - as
  demonstrated in my Keyboard Maestro Macro above, here's their
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://flexibits.com/fantastical/help/integration-with-other-apps&quot;
    &gt;documentation for integration with other apps&lt;/a
  &gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloud Based Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Using web services like IFTTT or Zapier to automate things based on calendar
  events can be limited if you're not using the &quot;right&quot; calendar system - so you
  can have IFTTT trigger things based on an event starting in Google calendar,
  but not in iCloud calendar. You can however use a variety of triggers from
  time and date, to RSS feed entries, to add events to your calendar on almost
  any system - as long as if it's iCloud you have the IFTTT app installed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Favourite Workflows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In this last part of the show we talked about our two favourite automations
  related to calendars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;David - Meeting Confirmation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img

    width=&quot;190&quot;
    height=&quot;190&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This workflow is really useful if you have meetings that you need to remind
  other people of, David actually has two - one for in person meetings, and one
  for scheduled calls. You can get them here:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/2995a75e01ef4bad9295a9f91d98d05d&quot;
      &gt;Meeting Confirmation&lt;/a
    &gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/0e2c5184e2c647a39dfb999f11b6dc62&quot;
      &gt;Phone Confirmation&lt;/a
    &gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rose - Workflow: Event Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a
    href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/automators-episode-1/workflow-event-review.png&quot;
    &gt;&lt;img
      class=&quot;alignright&quot;
      src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/workflow-event-review.png&quot;
      width=&quot;140&quot;
      height=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a
  &gt;I use this Workflow to help me review the events that have happened in the
  last week, as well as to prepare tasks for appointments in the upcoming week.
  This adds the calendar events from last week to a Drafts note, and combines
  any tasks you note down for the next week into Taskpaper and adds them to
  Omnifocus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You can get the workflow here:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/cda1965b59ae4ef19ece6958be097187&quot;
    &gt;Event Review&lt;/a
  &gt;

There are many ways you can automatically create calendar events, and it's useful to be able to do so, to avoid losing information. You can also use calendar events as a trigger to do something - which we cover towards the end. Below there are details of all the automations we cover, including 4 (really, four!) screencasts.</summary>

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/launching-automators-podcast/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Launching Automators: a Podcast About Automation" />
	  <published>2018-07-02T16:10:00+01:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/launching-automators-podcast</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/launching-automators-podcast/">&lt;p&gt;
  I've been asked several times if I have a podcast of my own, or a podcast
  about automation, and today I'm very excited to announce both: I'm launching a
  podcast with &lt;a href=&quot;https://macsparky.com&quot;&gt;David Sparks&lt;/a&gt; on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://relay.fm&quot;&gt;Relay FM&lt;/a&gt; called
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://automators.fm&quot;&gt;Automators&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  We plan for every episode to be approximately 30-45 minutes in length, and
  will release them every two weeks. Every episode will be accompanied by a blog
  post either on my blog or on David's where we provide all of the automations
  in the episode ready for download. The episodes will be released every two
  weeks on Fridays, which means you have the weekend ahead of you if you want to
  take our examples and go crazy!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This podcast is for everyone, you don't need to be a super nerd or a
  programmer - we are giving you the finished automations directly so you can
  just use them. You simply need some imagination (to think of things to
  automate), and a willingness to try things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you want an RSS feed of the blog posts which will accompany the episodes,
  you can find it via &lt;a href=&quot;https://automators.fm&quot;&gt;Automators.fm&lt;/a&gt; - these
  will link straight to David's blog post or my blog post, but is ideal for
  automation! We also have a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvpU-_RS85Y7q5PZsAaH87w&quot;
    &gt;YouTube Channel&lt;/a
  &gt;
  and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.automators.fm&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;, where you can see any
  screencasts we make, and discuss every episode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We created an episode 0 where we tell about the podcast, and David and I got a
  little carried away and made a Memoji version which you can actually watch!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I hope you'll &lt;a href=&quot;https://relay.fm/automators&quot;&gt;subscribe to the feed&lt;/a&gt;,
  and that you enjoy the first episode which is coming on Friday!
&lt;/p&gt;

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/my-raspberry-pi-zero-w-portable-development-server/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Raspberry Pi Zero W Portable Development Server" />
	  <published>2018-07-01T20:00:00+01:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/my-raspberry-pi-zero-w-portable-development-server</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/my-raspberry-pi-zero-w-portable-development-server/">&lt;p&gt;I love my iPad, it's a great, very portable device that I can use for almost everything. Unfortunately the almost for most people is a deal breaker - but I'm stubborn and see these things as a problem to be solved rather than a reason to use another device!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my most frequently used &quot;tools&quot; are servers - if you can call a server a tool. This blog runs on one, as does &lt;a href=&quot;https://automationorchard.com&quot;&gt;Automation Orchard&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a lot of little scripts which make my life easier. Unfortunately having an entire server running locally on an iPad isn't quite possible yet - apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id593757593?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;DraftCode Offline PHP IDE&lt;/a&gt; are fabulous and can even run Wordpress - but sometimes needs must, and you need something that is less restricted. This is where my Raspberry Pi Zero W comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/07/pi-on-a-plane.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi Zero W, for those of you not familiar with it, is an extremely small headless computer - it doesn't have a screen - indeed when you buy it you just get the board, that's it! The hard drive is a micro SD card, and it sports a few ports - 2 micro USB (one for power), and a mini HDMI. How on earth can you connect to that with an iPad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is not the shortest or easiest, but it does sound simple: wifi. I have set my Raspberry Pi up so that when it boots up it creates a wifi network, of course this doesn't create an internet connection, but that's not what we're after here. I won't go into the steps of setting this up here, instead I recommend you follow this guide: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md&quot;&gt;Setting Up a Raspberry Pi as an Access Point in a Standalone Network (NAT)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other part I needed to do was to make sure the Pi would always have the same IP address. This allows me to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rosemaryorchard.com/blog/remote-control-raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;use Workflow to control it via SSH&lt;/a&gt;, and connect to it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id500906297?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;Coda&lt;/a&gt; which lets me hook right into the device and has great syntax highlighting. As I mostly program for the web with PHP I use Coda in split screen with Safari which I can refresh to see the results of what I'm doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a CMS called Grav, and they have a nice little guide to help you set up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getgrav.org/blog/raspberrypi-nginx-php7-dev&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; to run it - there are guides to set up most CMS on a Pi if you look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would I do all of this over using something like Linode or Digital Ocean, you might ask. It's a very simple answer: internet isn't always a given. I travel a lot, and most of my flights do not have wifi (and those that do charge a fortune for it). Even trains go through tunnels where you lose your connection. If you always have wifi or cellular data then you can avoid carrying a tiny computer, cable and battery pack along with your iPad, but if you don't then this is a very small combination that gives you a lot of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware in use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You'll also need a microSD card and to set up the OS on it, if you're not sure where to begin you can buy one with &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepihut.com/products/noobs-preinstalled-sd-card&quot;&gt;NOOBS preinstalled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/managing-references-and-resources-when-writing-academic-papers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Managing References and Resources When Writing Academic Papers" />
	  <published>2018-06-27T08:00:00+01:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/managing-references-and-resources-when-writing-academic-papers</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/managing-references-and-resources-when-writing-academic-papers/">&lt;p&gt;Some of you may know that I'm studying for my Masters degree in Computing (Software Engineering), this naturally requires me to write more than a few essays with full referencing. Being a nerd I want to make this as easy as possible for myself, whilst still being accurate - and the simplest way to do this is to use software to manage my references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing some comparisons I settled on Zotero - it's free, which is perfect for a student budget, and you could program your own extensions if needed. More importantly it has a Word plugin which as I am required to submit my assignments in Word format is extremely useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you not familiar with referencing plugins and software you usually write your essay, and as you get to a place where you would insert a citation then you use the plugin in Word to do so. This software later generates a complete bibliography for you. EndNote, Mendeley, Bookends and Zotero are all capable of handling different citation formats, and Zotero even has one for my university's exact styling which is a great timesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each course or module I save all of the recommended reading into Zotero, they have browser plugins for Safari, Firefox, and Chrome which is ideal. By default Zotero saves PDFs if one is available for the reference, or a web snapshot. I prefer to save these items to DevonThink so use DevonThink's plugin to save the actual files to it instead. When saving the files I use the format &lt;code&gt;Author - year - title&lt;/code&gt; which makes it easy to find the relevant reference. DevonThink allows me to use &lt;em&gt;Edit in Place&lt;/em&gt; on iOS to annotate documents with whichever app I like. I also prefer to save web pages in PDF form which means I can annotate everything with PDF Expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove these attachments from my Zotero library (you only get 200MB of sync storage for free), I have created a saved search. It has &lt;code&gt;Item Type is Attachment&lt;/code&gt; as the sole criteria, and searches the whole library. I simply open this saved search, use CMD+A, and press delete - which deletes all of my attachments. As I prefer to use the search in DevonThink to find references I remember this isn't a problem, and I can also use the NEAR search parameter (&lt;code&gt;NEAR(man, cat)&lt;/code&gt; would find items where the word man is within 10 words of the word cat, you can expand on this with &lt;code&gt;NEAR(man, cat, 100)&lt;/code&gt; which would do the same but within 100 words - this is a massive timesaver for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes items added to Zotero do not always have the complete metadata - this tends to be my university website in my case. To fix these items I have a very useful smart folder and Keyboard Maestro Macro. The smart folder filters for items from my university website, which have no date or creator, the keyboard maestro macro requires me to set the number of items it should process and then goes through and uses the &quot;click at image&quot; action to set both the author and the date of the item in question. Zotero does have an API, but sometimes the best automation is the one you can set up the fastest which achieves the needed results - and this certainly fits that bill.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;DevonThink and Zotero are a very useful pair for me and I honestly think that without them I would struggle to complete my assignments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

As such as I have the following Workflow which allows me to defer items until I get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;: The first thing I do is input one or several tasks which I would like to accomplish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Split Text&lt;/code&gt;: Turn this block of text into a series of items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat with Each&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Change Case&lt;/code&gt;: Make the task sentence case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: Flag the tasks and my preferred tags - Home, Afternoon, and Evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;¬†&lt;code&gt;Combine Text&lt;/code&gt;: Turn this list back into a block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will want to tweak the tags added to the tasks, to suit your needs. You may also wish to remove the flag I add to these tasks. You can get the workflow here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/9808cc5297094a2e8608385c86e4a395&quot;&gt;OmniFocus When Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This workflow is intended to replace some of that functionality. You can share text to it, get text from the clipboard, type text in, or modify the text on the keyboard to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is choosing your action, you can create a new draft, and append or prepend to an existing draft - with the ID of the draft (&lt;a href=&quot;https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Gu&quot;&gt;Drafts Action to get ID&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you can choose to run an action after putting the text in Drafts, this is done by typing in the action name, though you may want to replace the &lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt; action with a &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt; if you have a few actions you regularly use.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/omnifocus-travel-plans/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-travel-plans/workflow-omnifocus-travel-plans.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/06/workflow-omnifocus-travel-plans.png&quot; width=&quot;192&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Another Workflow workflow I demonstrated in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://inside.omnifocus.com/rose-orchard/?ref=16&quot;&gt;Learn OmniFocus Video&lt;/a&gt; was one to generate a project for travel. I travel a fair amount, and often to more than one destination so this is built around that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I do is decide where I'm going and when I'll go there. Then the Workflow puts together the start of a &quot;before I go&quot; list - including entries such as booking time off work, booking flights, charging battery packs, etc. The next step is to choose if this is a one or a multiple destination trip, if it's just one location then I add a few entries for that - planning travel to and from the airport, things to do, and so on. If it's a multi destination trip then I have to tell the app which places I'm going and in what order, and it generates a series of tasks based on that. The last thing the template does is to add packing categories to my project, I keep my actual packing lists in TripList as it has a wizard which generates a list for me (I could replicate that in Workflow of course!) - and syncs things to my TripIt plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taskpaper result for a one destination trip looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2018/08 - Belgium:
    - Book time off work 11/08/2018 - 14/08/2018
    - Book flights to Belgium
    - Plan travel to the airport for 11/08/2018
    - Plan travel home from the airport for 14/08/2018
    - Make a packing list
    - Pack
    - Charge battery pack
    - Charge headphones
    - Put films &amp;amp; TV shows on iPad
    - Book accommodation for Belgium
    - Plan travel from the airport to accommodation (11/08/2018)
    - Plan travel from the accommodation to the airport (14/08/2018)
    - Plan things to do in Belgium
    - Packing
        - Clothing
        - Documents
        - Electronics
        - Miscellaneous
        - Hand luggage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a multiple destination trip you end up with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2018/08 - Belgium / Netherlands:
    - Book time off work 11/08/2018 - 18/08/2018
    - Book flights to Belgium
    - Plan travel to the airport for 11/08/2018
    - Plan travel home from the airport for 18/08/2018
    - Make a packing list
    - Pack
    - Charge battery pack
    - Charge headphones
    - Put films &amp;amp; TV shows on iPad
    - Belgium @autodone(true) @parallel(true)
        - Book accommodation for Belgium
        - Plan travel from the airport to accommodation
        - Plan things to do in Belgium
    - Netherlands @autodone(true) @parallel(true)
        - Plan travel from Belgium to Netherlands (14/08/2018)
        - Book accommodation for Netherlands
        - Plan things to do in Netherlands
    - Packing
        - Clothing
        - Documents
        - Electronics
        - Miscellaneous
        - Hand luggage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see there's not much of a difference - just the division and repetition of some tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the workflow here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/7311f351577f41a2bfba7fd755ec9812&quot;&gt;OmniFocus Travel Plans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at that Workflow and think that it's too complicated and I'm crazy (possible), then I also have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/9e1ee05ca67e43cbb23093b6999863f3&quot;&gt;simple version&lt;/a&gt; for one destination which you can get here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/9e1ee05ca67e43cbb23093b6999863f3&quot;&gt;OmniFocus Travel Plans - Simple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/workflow-omnifocus-university-course-template/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-omnifocus-university-course-template/workflow-omnifocus-university-course.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/06/workflow-omnifocus-university-course.png&quot; width=&quot;92&quot; height=&quot;92&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was asked to talk through my thought process behind a Workflow by &lt;em&gt;powderizedbookworm&lt;/em&gt; in the OmniFocus Slack, so this post will go into more detail than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this Workflow is to add my syllabus to my OmniFocus project for that class. The project will already exist as I have to register for the course, and potentially order course materials or communicate with the course professors before I get the syllabus. Each of my courses is separated into action groups - sometimes the courses divide their materials into weekly blocks, and sometimes they're divided into blocks based on assessments. I always put assessments in their own blocks, because they are broken into sub sections as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workflow should add each section of work or assessment to OmniFocus as an action group, deferred and due as is appropriate. As such the first thing it does after I input the project name (which is the class name) is to ask me how many sections there are in the course. We then go through every section inputting the name of it. If I know that the course is split into weeks then I modify this action in advance to just use &quot;Week &lt;code&gt;Repeat Index&lt;/code&gt;&quot; as the name of the section. I use the start and end dates to set due and defer dates, and then select if this section is to study something or to submit something (study or assignment). This is a menu which allows me to use different actions based on which option is selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study section, I input the tasks and format them as taskpaper. In the assignment section I input the name of the assignment and the number of questions it has which generates subtasks for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole Workflow generates TaskPaper and adds it to OmniFocus for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;: The course name (which is the project name in OmniFocus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;: How many sections or blocks does the course have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat&lt;/code&gt;: Going through every section/block
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;: The name of the section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;: The start date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;: The end date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose from Menu&lt;/code&gt;: Is this a study or assignment section/block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Study&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;: Input the tasks which need to be completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Split Text&lt;/code&gt;: Break up the lines of tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat with Each&lt;/code&gt;: For every task
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: Format it with a tab indent and the &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; used to indicate a task in TaskPaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Combine Text&lt;/code&gt;: Put these tasks back together with line breaks between them,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: Format the action group here, with the defer and due dates (these are inherited), followed by the tasks which were input and formatted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Assignment&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat with Each&lt;/code&gt;: For every task
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: Format it with a tab indent and the &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; used to indicate a task in TaskPaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Combine Text&lt;/code&gt;: Put these tasks back together with line breaks between them,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: Format the action group here, with the name of the assignment, defer date and due date and the questions as subtasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus&lt;/code&gt;: Put everything we've generated above into OmniFocus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review: Juuk Rainbow Watch Strap" />
	  <published>2018-06-01T15:00:00+01:00</published>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/">&lt;p&gt;A while ago I ordered a rainbow watch strap. Not just any rainbow watch strap, but an aluminium link, Apple Watch strap. I came across a purple link watch strap on Reddit months ago, fell in love and then was immensely disappointed it had sold out.  I did spot the rainbow strap on the same website though, and immediately put it on my wish list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then the rainbow strap has been in the back of my mind - I dislike buckles on watches, which is why I never tried to get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/05/apple-releases-rainbow-pride-edition-apple-watch-band-new-nike-sport-colors-now-available-to-order-through-apple%E2%80%A4com/&quot;&gt;Apple Pride strap&lt;/a&gt; despite loving the idea and colour combination. Similarly, I've never owned a link strap for my Apple Watch. My wrists are small, so unless the strap comes with an adjuster tool, it often ends up being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rosemaryorchard.com/microblog/2018-04-17-1451&quot;&gt;comically large&lt;/a&gt;. Juuk ships all of their watch straps with an adjuster tool, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://juukdesign.com/faq&quot;&gt;video guides for adjustment&lt;/a&gt; didn't look too hard to follow either - I decided to give it a whirl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paid for fast shipping, and shipping was &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;. I ordered May 1st; it was delivered May 5th. Of course, postage depends a lot on the postal services are involved and handover time - but it's safe to say I'm impressed. The watch was in an envelope, in a box - in a box. Good packaging so you could give the strap as a gift, and the recipient would be delighted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/outer-box.jpg?&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/outer-box.jpg?&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Outer box, brown cardboard&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/inner-box.jpg?&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/inner-box.jpg?&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Inner box, white with a picture of the strap on it and the Juuk logo at the top&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/strap-in-box.jpg?&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/strap-in-box.jpg?&lt;/a&gt; &quot;The strap in the box, in grey foam. There's a silver bar at the top and more foam above that.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
Inside the box in a box, was the watch strap. Nicely presented in specially cut out foam. I didn't realise to start with the metal bar at the top is the adjustment tool - with its own piece of foam on it to prevent you hurting yourself. The way it is laid out makes it look high quality - and it is too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strap itself has some heft to it - and you would expect it to. But being aluminium rather than steel it's not that heavy, making it comfortable to wear all day. Every link is a different colour graduating through the rainbow from the watch face on both sides, and it is designed so that one side has one more link than the other - to make it easier for you to put on and take off I presume, the idea being the shorter side brings the butterfly closure closer to the inside of your wrist. An extra nice touch is the last link above the closure has Juuk engraved into it, it't not highlighted in any colour and if you weren't looking for it you might miss it. I dislike wearing advertisements for brands unwillingly - but should I forget where I purchased this band (unlikely) I will still be able to see it and let people know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/adjustment-tool.jpg?&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/adjustment-tool.jpg?&lt;/a&gt;&quot; alt=&quot;The adjustment tool, a aluminium bar, with three points of varying heights to allow you to pop out the pins&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusting the watch strap was as easy as the video says. Make sure you don't put your fingers on the top of the pin you're trying to pop out, and I would personally have a small tray (such as the lid from a tube of Pringles) ready to put the pin and pin casings in. Unless you do this sort of thing regularly or have another strap to compare to for length you're going to have to adjust this with trial and error. I thought I had it adjusted perfectly, only to decide 20 minutes later that an extra link would be preferable - so keep the adjustment tool handy. There are extra &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first link strap I've bought that I can wear (I haven't managed to get the other one linked above adjusted yet), and it takes some getting used to. Putting it on the watch requires a little more coordination than I'm used to, as Milanese and sport loops are floppy and flexible, and the sport bands are of course two pieces - that's not a criticism of this band though, I went to the Apple Store to play and all the link straps are like that. I have found it's easiest to put both sides on at the same time now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/all-the-links-too-big.jpg?&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/all-the-links-too-big.jpg?&lt;/a&gt; &quot;The strap as it arrived, with all the links and much too big&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/removed-links-just-right.jpg?&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/juuk-rainbow-watch-strap/removed-links-just-right.jpg?&lt;/a&gt; &quot;After removing the links the strap fits very well&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this strap, it's fun, comfortable, nice quality, and easy to wear. It's not cheap, but it's much cheaper than the Apple ones. For people not into rainbow they also have a variety of solid colours, and even ones with a raised stripe/bar down the middle that remind me of racing cars. Some straps are available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2LdSgX4&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.juukdesign.com&quot;&gt;Juuk website&lt;/a&gt; has the full range and excellent customer service should you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/omnifocus-3-overview/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1346190318?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/omnifocus.png&quot; width=&quot;171&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;¬†&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1346190318?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;OmniFocus 3&lt;/a&gt; for iOS is here, and there's more than a few changes! If you want to see a video of my setup you can do so over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnomnifocus.com/tutorials/2018-05-23-omnifocus-workflows-rose-orchard/?ref=16&quot;&gt;Learn OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;, there's also an article on how I've been using OF3 over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://inside.omnifocus.com/rose-orchard/?ref=16&quot;&gt;Inside OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;. Finally you might want to check on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rosemaryorchard.com/blog/omnifocus-3-sneak-peak&quot;&gt;OmniFocus Sneak Peak&lt;/a&gt; - though that was back in March and more than a few things have changed since then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Multi-Pane Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-overview/3-pane-view.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/3-pane-view.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite feature has to be the multi pane view, being able to see 3 columns at once makes me happy, and it works exceptionally well on the 12.9&quot; iPad Pro. You can choose to pin the sidebar and the inspector independently of one another or together, so you can have a 2 pane view if that's what you need. The outline view is always shown on the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tags, glorious tags. What used to be contexts has been renamed, and that opens up all sorts of possibilities. I've seen people experimenting with energy levels, I'm personally experimenting with &quot;time of day&quot; tags, and you can go as crazy as you like. Where tags are really paying off for me is being able to add both &quot;waiting on&quot; and &quot;Person A&quot; to a task - so whenever I check my agenda for &quot;Person A&quot; I see that I'm waiting on that task, as well as seeing it in my waiting on list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perspectives are where everything is different. All your perspectives have been migrated over from OmniFocus 2, and you can upgrade those to OmniFocus 3 perspectives which gives you the following options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Status
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due Soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flagged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First Available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remaining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a due date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a defer date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has an estimated duration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has an estimated duration less than
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is untagged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a tag which
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is on hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is dropped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is active and has available actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is active and has no available actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is tagged with any of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is tagged with all of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is not a project or group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is in the inbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a project which
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is active or on hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is on hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has been completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has been dropped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is active and has available actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is active and has no available actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is active and has a future defer date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is contained within a project or folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matches search terms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the following&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any of the following&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of the following&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of perspectives is being able to add as many rules as you like. The top level is always &quot;All of the following&quot;, and then you start adding rules within that. You can also add &quot;Any of the following&quot;, &quot;None of the following&quot; and &quot;All of the following&quot; and add rules inside of those - useful for requiring a group of rules (e.g. flagged and has Tag X), or setting optional groups. I have a &quot;Now&quot; perspective which changes all the time, and I tap the rule above my Work folder to change it to &quot;All of the following&quot; to &quot;None of the following&quot; depending on if I'm at work or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-overview/now-perspective.jpg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/now-perspective.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Batch Editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to edit more than one task at once is not a feature I need frequently, but it is one I really appreciate when I use it. You can enable it by tapping the &quot;Edit&quot; button in the top right, and then selecting multiple tasks. You can access the task inspector in the batch edit mode, and it will show you all of the properties which are the same, and a greyed out option where they're different. If I selected two tasks, one had a due date of today and one with tomorrow, I could still set a new due date for both items at the same time though. You can also use CMD+A to select all the tasks in the current view if you have an external keyboard attached - very useful if your inbox was empty, you added a lot of tasks and then realised they should have been in a project instead!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/batch-editing.PNG&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1536&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Custom Repeats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love repeating tasks, my problem is my repeating tasks aren't all that regular (at least most of them), thankfully I can handle this in OmniFocus 3. You can set repeats with an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly interval, but you can also say &quot;every Tuesday and Saturday&quot;, or &quot;the first Wednesday of every month&quot;, or &quot;the last day of every month&quot;. This has made submitting my work timesheets much easier to remember.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-overview/repeat-options.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/repeat-options.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tasks are very important, so important you want flashing lights, sirens, and people in hazmat suits running around if the deadline gets too close. In the main settings you can specify notifications for due dates and defer dates globally, and these can also be enabled or removed on each task. You are also able to set two extra kinds of notifications - ones relative to the due date, and ones at a specific date and time. These reminders are a great help with those crucial tasks - if you need someone with a hazmat suit though you're on your own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-overview/notifications.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/notifications.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Customisable Inspector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people love defer dates, some people hate them. Some people don't want notifications or repeats, for others those are on every task. In OmniFocus 3 you can choose which properties you want to see by default in the inspector - just open up a task, tag or project and tap &quot;Customize Inspector&quot; at the bottom to move the items you want to where you want them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forecast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecast has changed a lot in OmniFocus 3, there are two major changes which I'll look at here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interleaved Events &amp;amp; Due Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/omnifocus-3-overview/forecast-view.PNG?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/forecast-view.PNG&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1536&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calendar events are interleaved with due items in your day. Instead of the gantt chart style event display in in OF2 (which at least for me wasn't very helpful), they are nice big blocks which show which calendar they're on, when they start and when they end. If you have a meeting 9am-10am, and then a due date at 10:30 that's the order you'll see your tasks in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forecast Tag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now choose a task to display in the forecast view, this is ideal for things like routine tasks, a sprint at work (a series of tasks or projects to be completed within a specific time period), or errands. You can choose different forecast tags per device, so on your iPhone you might choose calls or errands, but on your iPad it could be &quot;secret nerdy tasks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of big changes in OmniFocus 3, and based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2018#omnifocus3&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; there will be a lot more to come, but first of all we have WWDC and the Mac app to look forward to!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/workflow-omnifocus-trigger-list/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/workflow-omnifocus-trigger-list.png&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt; A workflow I frequently run to help me remember tasks is my Trigger List workflow. For those of you not familiar with them, trigger lists are essentially prompts you use to help you remember things you may have forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workflow is very simple, it has a list of items at the top, goes through each item and asks you what's on your mind regarding it. Then it takes all of these items and puts them in your OmniFocus Inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've uploaded two &quot;flavours&quot; of this Workflow, one where the trigger word is noted after the task in brackets, and the other where the trigger word becomes the parent task of an action group, with your triggered tasks inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/240e9f7af97b428d8e7c3981b1c00558&quot;&gt;Trigger word in brackets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/93c12b7a53a34f758ea84e729065a4c7&quot;&gt;Action groups with the trigger word as the parent task&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need some inspiration for your trigger list the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://gettingthingsdone.com/free-articles/mind_sweep_trigger_list/&quot;&gt;GTD Trigger Lists&lt;/a&gt; are a great place to start - and there are trigger list examples all over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One enhancement you might make is to have more than one of these workflows - one at home, and one at work. You could also trigger the Workflow to run at a specific time with &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id532016360?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;Launch Center Pro&lt;/a&gt; - I do this as it's one of my tasks which kicks off my weekly review. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://launchcenterpro.com/y9k96x&quot;&gt;Launch Center Pro action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/workflow-menus-lists-dictionaries/">&lt;p&gt;When should you use a list or a menu. What about a dictionary? If you're not a programmer and have had little experience with writing for computers in general then this can be a little overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list is exactly what it sounds like. You have a list of items, and you can choose from them or get a specific item (at an index, so the 1st or 5th item for example). A list gives you what you choose - so if you have a list of animals, when you choose &quot;Cat&quot; you get &quot;Cat&quot; - fairly simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make lists in a few ways, if you &lt;code&gt;Add to Variable&lt;/code&gt; you can get that variable and use &lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt;. You can also &lt;code&gt;Split Text&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt; again. There is also the list action you can add items to - and you follow it with a &lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt; action again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-menus-lists-dictionaries/workflow-list.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/workflow-list.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Menus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A menu is a list of items which contain actions - this is ideal if you want to be able to do different things based on the option chosen (e.g. reminder vs calendar event vs note). You don't get the text of the menu item after you click it, though you can work around this by using the &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; action if you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-menus-lists-dictionaries/workflow-menu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Workflow Menu Action&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dictionaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dictionary is somewhere between a list and a menu in many ways. If I choose &quot;Spaghetti Bolognese&quot; then a dictionary can return &quot;ground beef, tomatoes, onion, spaghetti...&quot;. This can have all sorts of applications - and Workflow actually gives you dictionaries a lot of the time when you put the &lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt; action after another, such as &lt;code&gt;Search App Store&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Dictionaries can really help improve your Workflow experience. Maybe you want to have a simple list of people, and when you select one you get that person's phone number - or maybe you want to get complicated and go crazy. That's all possible with dictionaries.&lt;br /&gt;
A dictionary is a series of keys and values. The key is what you choose, and the value is what you get. There are multiple ways to make dictionaries in Workflow - the simplest way though is to use the Dictionary action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-menus-lists-dictionaries/workflow-dictionary-choose-from-list.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/05/workflow-dictionary-choose-from-list.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tips and tricks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can order lists, menus, and dictionaries manually using the grab handles on the side of their action blocks. But a list or dictionary can also be sorted by its key using the &lt;code&gt;Filter files&lt;/code&gt; action. You can use this to sort the keys alphabetically. This won't change the list or the dictionary in your editing view, but it will change before you choose or get an item from it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/siri-watch-face</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/siri-watch-face/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/siri-watch-face/apple-watch-siri-face-home-calendar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apple Watch Face showing a homekit scene and a calendar entry&quot;&gt; The Siri Watch face has been an unexpected gem for me - it is limited but still very useful. One thing many people miss is that you can customise the data sources for the watch face - so if you don't want to see reminders to breathe, or the stocks then you don't need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Siri watch face only allows you to have one complication, which complicates matters somewhat (pun intended!). I have chosen Carrot weather, because the weather in Vienna &lt;em&gt;tends&lt;/em&gt; to stay somewhat stable throughout the day, this means I can turn off the Weather source in the watch face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/siri-watch-face/apple-watch-blank-siri-face.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blank Siri Face - Have a Nice Day&quot;&gt; What is limiting is that 3rd party app developers can't integrate into the Siri face - at least not directly. I have managed to get my OmniFocus data into it though - by subscribing to my OmniFocus calendar on my iPhone. This calendar is hidden, and does have the unfortunate side effect of giving me an extra notification when each task is due if I let it get that far - but for me the trade off is well worth it. You can manage the calendars shown on your Apple Watch in the Watch app, under Calendars. I don't have this mirror my iPhone as I am subscribed to many calendars and toggle those on and off as needed - but I still don't want birthdays showing up on my watch face as that's a bit late reminder wise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the last year the Siri face has been very successful in providing me the data I want when I want it - possibly because I don't have many data sources enabled. If you tried it before and gave up on it then I would recommend giving it another shot - perhaps with less data this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    alt=&quot;Overlay Contact Information On Wallpaper&quot;
  /&gt;
  A while ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://katiefloyd.com&quot;&gt;Katie Floyd&lt;/a&gt; put out a call on
  Twitter looking for a replacement app which can overlay contact information
  onto your wallpaper for iOS. I thought &quot;I bet you can do this with Workflow&quot;,
  and I was right! Here's how it works.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Text&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: This contains your name.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Text&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: This contains your phone number, advice: Don't use the
    number of your iPhone, use that of a trusted family member or friend, or
    your home phone if you have one.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Text&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: HTML formatting of the above two items, your name is
    set to be smaller than the phone number as it's likely to be longer and not
    quite as important.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/RichText.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Make Rich Text from HTML&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Make Rich Text from HTML&lt;/code&gt;: Now we make that HTML into rich
    Text - applying the formatting.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/PDF.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Make PDF&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Make PDF&lt;/code&gt;: Bear with me, PDFs are great!
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Image.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Convert Image&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Convert Image&lt;/code&gt;: PDFs can be converted to images - voila! We
    now have a white image with black text.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Image.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Crop Image&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Crop Image&lt;/code&gt;: Let's make this approximately the same aspect
    ratio as an iPhone X screen.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Image.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Resize Image&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Resize Image&lt;/code&gt;: Shrink it down to be about the right size
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Set Variable&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set Variable&lt;/code&gt;: Make it easy to access in a moment.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Photos.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Select Photos&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Select Photos&lt;/code&gt;: Choose your background.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Image.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Mask Image&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mask Image&lt;/code&gt;: Here's the magic. The mask image action is like a
    very smart overlay, here it will make sure the text of your name and contact
    number shows up on the wallpaper, and nothing else.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/QuickLook.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Quick Look&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Quick Look&lt;/code&gt;: Check it for prettiness.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Sharing.png&quot;
      alt=&quot;Share&quot;
      class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;
    /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Share&lt;/code&gt;: Save it where you want!
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img
    src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/overlay-contact-information-on-wallpaper/example-before-after-iphone-wallpaper.png&quot;
    alt=&quot;The original wallpaper, and the wallpaper with the contact information overlay&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://automationorchard.com&quot;&gt;Automation Orchard&lt;/a&gt; is where I've collected every article, podcast and even video I've found regarding any automation topic related to Apple, from Workflow to IFTTT, and Automator to AppleScript. It doesn't have everything - yet, but it has a lot. So if you were trying to find a Workflow workflow to work with Trello, you could search and find a lot of options. All of this content links back to the original website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/launching-automation-orchard/automation-orchard.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/launching-automation-orchard/automation-orchard.png?lightbox=1024&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Automation Orchard&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a forum, this is split up into sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn - housing lessons, challenges, and questions based on language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac - for questions and posts about automating things on your Mac, including using AppleScript, Keyboard Maestro, et. al.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS - for automation on iOS, including Workflow and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web - the place to talk about IFTTT, Zapier, Microsoft Flow, and other cool web automation services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home - where you can discuss home automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General - for everything else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/launching-automation-orchard/automation-orchard-forum.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/launching-automation-orchard/automation-orchard-forum.png?lightbox=1024&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Automation Orchard Forums&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? I love to automate, I love to help people automate. The website has become my Wikipedia - if I want to find a DEVONThink Workflow then I know where to search, and I know I'll probably find helpful related content too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum only has a few posts in it right now - started by me. I hope to see many of you there, asking questions, sharing your automations, and discussing why we automate!&lt;/p&gt;

It's a very simple browser which uses the Safari engine, and it's purpose is to allow you to view two different web pages at once. This feature has been built into iOS since Sidefari was released, but it still has it's place for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidefari wins over the built in Safari split screen for me in two ways: I am not required to have 50/50 split of the two web pages, and I can take one of those apps to a different space entirely if I wish to do so. This really helps me to work effectively on iOS. You can also use Sidefari as a browser with no tabs - useful if you are trying to avoid being sucked down a rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1046968235?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;Sidefari - Web browsing companion for Safari&lt;/a&gt; is available for free on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/workflows-for-project-planning-with-trello-and-omnifocus/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/roseorchard/recommend&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; is a lovely service which offers Kanban boards for planning - and I often like to plan out projects there, especially ones that need to be done in multiple stages or have many areas of focus. OmniFocus is my task manager of choice though which means I need my tasks to end up in there to have any hope of accomplishing them. To this end I have created a few &lt;a href=&quot;http://workflow.is&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt; workflows to get the data out of Trello and into OmniFocus, they‚Äôre not very sophisticated - but they function very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Single Trello List to OmniFocus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflows-for-project-planning-with-trello-and-omnifocus/workflow-trello-list-to-omnifocus.png&quot; alt=&quot;Trello List To OmniFocus&quot;&gt; Maybe you just have one list in Trello and you want to get the tasks and put them in OmniFocus. This workflow does exactly that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Trello Items&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Trello Items&lt;/code&gt;:  This gets all of your Trello boards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose from List&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt;: You choose the board you want to get data from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Trello Items&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Trello Items&lt;/code&gt;: Then we get all of the lists in the board you just chose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose from List&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt;: Now you choose which list you want to grab the cards from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Trello Items&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Trello Items&lt;/code&gt;: We get all of the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Repeat with Each&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat with Each&lt;/code&gt;: We go through each card.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot; alt=&quot;Text&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: We format the title and the description of the card to be the name of the text and the note (in TaskPaper format notes are indented on a new line after their task).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot; alt=&quot;Combine Text&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Combine Text&lt;/code&gt;: We put all of the cards together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus&lt;/code&gt;: The data gets added to OmniFocus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the workflow here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/fc2e1d8c67534fa984a6e58848beb4af&quot;&gt;Trello List To OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multiple Trello Lists to OmniFocus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflows-for-project-planning-with-trello-and-omnifocus/workflow-multiple-trello-lists-to-omnifocus.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multiple Trello Lists To OmniFocus&quot;&gt; If you have several lists on a board you want to get into OmniFocus then this Workflow will allow you to do that. It will create a task or action group for each list with sub tasks for each card in that list in Trello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Trello Items&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Trello Items&lt;/code&gt;: Get your Trello boards here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose from List&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt;: Choose the Trello board you want to get the lists from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Trello Items&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Trello Items&lt;/code&gt;: Get the lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose from List&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt;: Choose one or many lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Repeat with Each&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat with Each&lt;/code&gt;: With each list
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Set Variable&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set Variable&lt;/code&gt;: Set the &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; variable to be the name of the list. Working with multiple repeats can get a bit tricky, hence not using the &lt;code&gt;Repeat Item&lt;/code&gt; variables here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Trello Items&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Trello Items&lt;/code&gt;: Get the cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Repeat with Each&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat with Each&lt;/code&gt;: For every card
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Set Variable&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set Variable&lt;/code&gt;: Set the &lt;code&gt;card&lt;/code&gt; variable to be the card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Details of Trello Item&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Details of Trello Item&lt;/code&gt;: Get the name of the Trello card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Variable&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Variable&lt;/code&gt;: Get the &lt;code&gt;card&lt;/code&gt; variable back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Details of Trello Item&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Details of Trello Item&lt;/code&gt;: Get the description of the Trello card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot; alt=&quot;Text&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: Format this in TaskPaper format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot; alt=&quot;Combine Text&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Combine Text&lt;/code&gt;: Put all of the TaskPaper together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot; alt=&quot;Text&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: Add the name of the list to the top of this TaskPaper format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot; alt=&quot;Combine Text&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Combine Text&lt;/code&gt;: Put all of the lists of TaskPaper tasks together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus&lt;/code&gt;: Put it all into OmniFocus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the workflow here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/0f2790c37e314e9eabf722c8fa76b9c8&quot;&gt;Multiple Trello Lists To OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trello Board to OmniFocus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflows-for-project-planning-with-trello-and-omnifocus/workflow-trello-board-to-omnifocus-project.png&quot; alt=&quot;Trello Board To OmniFocus Project&quot;&gt; If you have planned your whole project in Trello and want to move it over to OmniFocus then this Workflow will help you do so. It makes the whole board into one project, with each list becoming an action group and the cards becoming tasks inside of those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Trello Items&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Trello Items&lt;/code&gt;: This gets all of your Trello boards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose from List&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt;: You choose the Trello Board you want to make into an OmniFocus project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Trello Items&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Trello Items&lt;/code&gt;: This gets all of the lists in the Trello Board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Repeat with Each&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat with Each&lt;/code&gt;: For every list.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Set Variable&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set Variable&lt;/code&gt;: Set the variable to the list - multiple repeats can be a little tricky to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/trello.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Trello Items&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Trello Items&lt;/code&gt;: Get all of the cards inside of this list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Repeat with Each&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat with Each&lt;/code&gt;: For each card
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Set Variable&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set Variable&lt;/code&gt;: Set the variable to the card.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot; alt=&quot;Text&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: Combine the name, due date and the description into TaskPaper format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Workflows are very helpful to me - and get more use than I thought they would! I hope you find a use for them too.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Steps: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Calculator.png&quot; alt=&quot;Count&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Count&lt;/code&gt;: This checks for input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;If&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;If&lt;/code&gt;: If there is no input...
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Text.png&quot; alt=&quot;Text&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;: Show you your clipboard and allow you to edit it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;If&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Else&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Variable&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Variable&lt;/code&gt;: Get the input you provided to the Workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/&quot; alt=&quot;Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus&quot; title=&quot;Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus&quot; /&gt; &lt;code&gt;Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus&lt;/code&gt;: This asks you to choose where you want to add the TaskPaper: Inbox,  Projects, Folder, Project, or Task. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/using-drafts-5-taskpaper-with-omnifocus/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-2923 size-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/Drafts-Capture-Act-150x150.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have created an any action group for Drafts 5 which is meant to help you create Taskpaper formatted projects or tasks and then send it all along to OmniFocus afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you will want to do is to create a Draft with the Taskpaper format. This is the last but one action in the action group - the reasoning being you're not likely to need it as often as some of the others! It simply opens a new Drafts with the format set to taskpaper - you can do this yourself by tapping the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; icon if you're in a Draft, and then using the &lt;code&gt;Aa&lt;/code&gt; button to set the &lt;em&gt;Syntax Highlighting&lt;/em&gt; of the current draft to Taskpaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first action in the group is a tab, this is for iPhone users and iPad users without an external keyboard and it simply inserts a tab wherever the cursor currently is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next action is Placeholder, if you have text selected it will wrap the text in &lt;code&gt;¬´¬ª&lt;/code&gt; characters, and if no text is selected it will insert them. This is ideal for dates in templates you will want to update later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Due action takes advantage of the natural language parsing that OmniFocus has available via URL Scheme. Again, if you have text selected it will wrap it in &lt;code&gt;@due()&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise that will be inserted empty for you to fill in the brackets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Defer, Estimate, Tags, and Context actions work the same way as Due. Tags and context are both available so if you're on the OmniFocus 3 beta or simply want to prepare your templates to work for both 2 and 3 you can already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tags (suggest) offers a list of tags for you to choose from, allows you to choose more than one of them, and inserts them inside &lt;code&gt;@tag()&lt;/code&gt;. You will need to edit this script to make it work for you - the &lt;code&gt;&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is the part that needs changing. Bear in mind that a long list of tags will be annoying to look through most likely. If you want any tags to be pre-selected for you (e.g. you usually add the &lt;code&gt;evening&lt;/code&gt; tag to tasks created via Drafts), you can put that into the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; after the tag list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autodone asks you if you want the task or project to be automatically completed when the tasks inside of it are completed and inserts &lt;code&gt;@autodone(true)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@autodone(false)&lt;/code&gt;as per your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Repeat Method allows you to choose how the task should repeat, and inserts &lt;code&gt;@repeat-method(fixed)&lt;/code&gt;, or whichever the relevant choice is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Repeat Rule is very simple, but allows you to choose if a task should be repeated every X days, weeks, months, or years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parallel works the same way Autodone does, if the project should be parallel (actions able to be worked on at the same time) then &lt;code&gt;@parallel(true)&lt;/code&gt; is inserted, if not &lt;code&gt;@parallel(false)&lt;/code&gt; appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flagged just inserts &lt;code&gt;@flagged&lt;/code&gt; when it is run - which adds a flag to a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due and Defer are here again - but this time with date and time pickers. This allows you to choose an exact date and time when your task or project is due. I've used European date formatting, but you can modify that to any other date formatting by replacing the &lt;code&gt;&quot;dd-MM-yyyy hh:mm&quot;&lt;/code&gt; (for example in North America you might prefer &lt;code&gt;&quot;MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm&quot;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimate makes another appearance, this time it asks you to choose how many minutes, hours, days or weeks something will take and fills in the &lt;code&gt;@estimate()&lt;/code&gt; for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final action in this set is Taskpaper to OF. This will ask you where you want to save your Draft (as a new project, a new project in a folder, as tasks in a specifc project, or the inbox), go through any &lt;code&gt;¬´placeholders¬ª&lt;/code&gt; you have and help you replace them (important &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; is always going to be replaced with whatever you tell the script when it asks you about it, so make sure you to use unique placeholders where necessary!), and then send everything off to OmniFocus. Once you return if it did have placeholders to replace it offers to make a new Draft, update your current Draft, or do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This action group is set up as a keyboard group, which should make quick entry easier. You can get the action group from the Draft 5 Action Directory: &lt;a href=&quot;https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1F6&quot;&gt;OF Taskpaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/my-drafts-5-review/">&lt;p&gt;[TOC]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Intro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;156&quot; height=&quot;156&quot; /&gt;For those of you not familiar with Drafts, it‚Äôs designed as an app which lets you input text and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; decide what to do with it. Why? Sometimes that message turns into an email, or maybe the quick idea turns into a mind map. Or maybe you just don‚Äôt know where the text is going to end up when you start writing. Drafts is designed to let you write and then process the text, removing the need to choose where the text should go first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-main-views.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-main-views.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you open Drafts you get a blank note - automatically. You can set the time out period so that when you return to Drafts you either see your last note or a new note - mine is set to the default of 60 seconds. You can also open the app with force touch which allows you to create a new blank note, create a note from the clipboard, dictate a note, search, or open any one of your 4 most recently edited Drafts. The first three of these options, plus the choice to import a file, appear when you force touch the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; on an iPhone, or press and hold on an iPad. The great part about the dictation is that unlike regular Siri dictation there‚Äôs no timeout, that‚Äôs right - you can dictate for as long as you like. David Sparks made a great introduction to Drafts 5 which I highly recommend: &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/263943764&quot;&gt;Drafts 5 Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-force-touch-icon.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-force-touch-icon.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;413&quot; height=&quot;537&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-new-drafts-options.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-new-drafts-options.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;404&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Changed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may have used Drafts before, in fact if you‚Äôre reading this it‚Äôs likely you have so what‚Äôs new? First of all the app has been completely rewritten, this means everything is new and shiny - and 100% up to date. There's also lots of new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, you can import all of your notes to Drafts and most of your actions. Make sure you're running the latest version of Drafts 4, and then in the settings of Drafts 5, tap &quot;Migrate from Drafts 4&quot;. You can choose to import your Drafts, and/or Actions and Keys. You can also export from Drafts 4 into Drafts 5 - there's a special &lt;a href=&quot;http://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/2Nv&quot;&gt;Send to Drafts 5&lt;/a&gt; for drafts, and inside each action in Drafts 4 you can choose to migrate the action, or add it as a callback so when the action is executed it is done so in Drafts 4 and then returns you to Drafts 5. Not every action which was available in Drafts 4 is available yet in Drafts 5, but Drafts 5 will make a list of the actions that couldn't be imported so you can handle those manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Themes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drafts 4 had three theme choices - white, cream and black - and the ability to automatically switch to the black theme at a certain brightness threshold. Drafts 5 has several more colour theme options, and you can specify a day theme and a night theme to work with, which will switch at the brightness level you prefer. Choose the theme is a pro feature, and I've really enjoyed using the dark Solarized theme during the day with black at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-theme-options.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-theme-options.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Custom Icons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing app icons is definitely a nice way to make your device yours, and Drafts now offers the ability to choose your app icon. There's a mix of flat images and ones with gradients - I personally picked the purple as that's my favourite colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-app-icons.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-app-icons.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tagging and Flagging&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tagging allows you to optionally file your note in multiple places - and helps you to group together notes on a particular topic as well. Tags are shown under a draft in the list of drafts. When adding a tag to a draft you can see a list of your current tags in the keyboard bar, if the one you are looking for doesn't exist then you can type to create it. Tags are lower case - you can type capitals when creating them but they will be formatted for you. This is really useful as it allows you to avoid having &lt;code&gt;Groceries&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;groceries&lt;/code&gt; by accident.&lt;br /&gt;
Flagging is simple - a draft is flagged, or it is not flagged. You can use it however makes the most sense to you.&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-flagging-tagging-a-draft.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-flagging-tagging-a-draft.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Filtering&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have filters we need to be able to work with them. Filtering allows us to choose combinations of tags to see or not as we want. By tapping the name of a tag in the filter section we add it to include, and by tapping the &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-ban&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (ban) icon we can add the tag to the omitted list. This means you could include the tags &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt;, but disallow &lt;code&gt;spider&lt;/code&gt;. These tags are combined with an &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;, so only drafts with &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the included tags and &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the omitted tags will show up.&lt;br /&gt;
Tags are not the only settings however, you can also set how much of a draft you want to see in the list, the sort order, if flagged items should be included or not, specific text to search for and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-filters.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-filters.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;711&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;¬†&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-workspace-options.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-workspace-options.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;1780&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;http://getdrafts.com/drafts/listoptions&quot;&gt;filtering in Drafts&lt;/a&gt; is well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Workspaces&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workspaces can be created in two ways, from a filter you are currently using, or from scratch. They have the same set up as filters, but as you can name them and set the colour and icon to represent they are easy to keep track of. You can set the order that you would like to view your Workspaces in, and optionally show them, with or without their name, at the bottom of the list of Drafts. Workspaces are ideal for filters you make frequently, or which are more complex to construct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-workspaces-overview.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-workspaces-overview.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;534&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-workspaces-below-draft-list.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-workspaces-below-draft-list.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-untagged-workspace.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-untagged-workspace.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Focus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default Drafts will open to a new draft after a set period of time - which can be adjusted by you. Focus mode allows you to do that by focusing on one particular draft, this means that whenever you open the app - even if that's next month - you'll be back at the draft you had open last. You can enable focus mode in two ways, by tapping the eye icon in the bottom left hand side of the editor when you're not editing a draft, or by opening the Settings and enabling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SiriKit Integration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Siri, make a note in Drafts to investigate buying the llama farm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now create new Drafts using Siri, it's simple but effective. You can also dictate notes, but that's not new - what's very useful though is that the dictation will not end as it does usually when dictating elsewhere on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-siri-integration.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-siri-integration.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Editor Options&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Drafts you can now control a lot of settings with regards to how the editor appears, from paragraph numbers to syntax highlighting, and even whether or not the toolbar or the status bar should show you have plenty of choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-syntax-options.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-syntax-options.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-editor-with-without-toolbar.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-editor-with-without-toolbar.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-appearance-options.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-appearance-options.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the options you can choose to set for the editor by tapping the &lt;code&gt;Aa&lt;/code&gt; button:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plain text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple List&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taskpaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Font
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose from any of the fonts pre-installed on iOS, or ones you have installed yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select a particular font to use for Monospaced text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line height&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paragraph spacing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paragraph numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can enable or disable
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autocorrect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spell check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart punctuation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dashes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitalisation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None or sentences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portrait, landscape, or any (only on iPhone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draft 5 also has an improved arrange mode, Drafts 4 just allowed you to rearrange lines, Drafts 5 lets you edit blocks (separated by two line breaks) or lines, edit sections, and delete or remove them. You can also trigger the arrange mode via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://getdrafts.com/urls/&quot;&gt;URL scheme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a pre-installed Tasks action, which is shown on your keyboard by default. This is very clever, it makes the line that you're on or the text you have selected into a simple bullet checklist by adding &lt;code&gt;- [ ]&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of the line. By tapping on the &lt;code&gt;[ ]&lt;/code&gt; you can mark a task as done &lt;code&gt;[x]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;¬†Actions and Keyboard Groups&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you familiar with Workflow, actions are very similar in some ways. An action can contain any number of steps, a number of which are provided for you to use as is. Drafts does not arrive empty, it comes with 5 &lt;a href=&quot;http://getdrafts.com/actions/examples/&quot;&gt;example action groups&lt;/a&gt;, 4 of which are available as keyboard groups for you - you can do what you like with these actions, including delete them. But if you're not familiar with Drafts and it's actions I recommend you swipe across the action from left to write, tap edit, and have a look.&lt;br /&gt;
One important change between Drafts 4 and Drafts 5 is there is no longer an app wide default as to what to do once an action has been executed, you now set this per action group. This is very useful so if you have a group of &quot;share&quot; actions for example, designed to get the text out of Drafts, you could immediately have the draft the action was executed on archived or trashed as you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;
You can choose to enable an action group on the keyboard, Draft has a row of buttons above the keyboard, and if you have multiple groups of keyboard actions you can swipe up and down on this row to switch between them. As you can assign keyboard shortcuts to actions as well this becomes very powerful very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-action-steps.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-action-steps.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Scripting in Drafts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most powerful part of Drafts actions is the Script action, this is what it sounds like - you write a script which does things. Drafts uses JavaScript, if you use OmniGroup products they are introducing JavaScript for automation in those too - so learning the language could definitely pay off in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;
There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agiletortoise/drafts-documentation/wiki&quot;&gt;a wiki about Drafts scripting&lt;/a&gt;, which is definitely worth reading if you intend to use them.&lt;br /&gt;
My favourite functions that can be included in Scripting is the Prompt - so if you want to ask the user &quot;cats or dogs&quot;, you could create a prompt which shows &quot;cats&quot; and &quot;dogs&quot; as buttons, and then depending on which they choose your script would react accordingly. A prompt can have any of the following options&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text Fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date and or Time Fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selects - single or multiple choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-script-prompt.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-script-prompt.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the script to create that prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var p = Prompt.create();

p.title = &quot;Title&quot;;
p.message = &quot;Message&quot;;

p.addTextField(&quot;myTextField&quot;, &quot;Text Field&quot;, &quot;&quot;);
p.addDatePicker(&quot;myDate&quot;, &quot;Date Field&quot;, new Date(), {
  &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;date&quot;
});
p.addDatePicker(&quot;myTime&quot;, &quot;Time Field&quot;, new Date(), {
  &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;time&quot;
});
p.addDatePicker(&quot;myDateTime&quot;, &quot;Date &amp;amp; Time Field&quot;, new Date(), {
  &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;dateAndTime&quot;
});
p.addSelect(&quot;mySingleSelect&quot;, &quot;Single Select Field&quot;, [&quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Dog&quot;, &quot;Llama&quot;], [], false);
p.addSelect(&quot;myMultipleSelect&quot;, &quot;Multiple Select Field&quot;, [&quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Dog&quot;, &quot;Llama&quot;], [], true);
p.addButton(&quot;Button&quot;);

p.show();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cancel button is in a prompt by default, but you can hide it if you wish. The prompt will definitely make an appearance in actions you import from the action directory - if only because it's a great way to get credentials from you which can be used in an action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Credentials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to Tweet with Drafts, save something to Evernote, or add tasks to Todoist, there are two ways to do that. Passing the data to the app on your device and telling it what to do - which is not possible with every app - or by using the API of the service to complete the action. The difficulty with an API is you need a token to access it - similar to needing a username and password to log in. Drafts 5 has a clever way to store these, so that scripts can access them without needing to save the access key in the script itself - so there's no worry that by sharing your Todoist action people can start adding things to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; Todoist, unless you explicitly want them to do so and share your credential! You can change the credentials saved in Drafts by tapping on the Settings wheel in the bottom right of the editor, and opening Credentials. By choosing the &quot;forget&quot; option the credential is deleted, and you can input a new one the next time you run an action that needs it. This system is especially useful as you can share one credential with many scripts - so it doesn't matter if you have 1 or 100 Todoist scripts, they can all access the same key, and you are in charge of it. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agiletortoise/drafts-documentation/wiki/Credential&quot;&gt;documentation for credentials in scripts&lt;/a&gt; is definitely worth reading if you want to access APIs, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://getdrafts.com/settings/credentials&quot;&gt;general documentation&lt;/a&gt; is also very helpful - especially if you have multiple accounts you want to interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-credentials.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-credentials.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;¬†Price&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drafts 5 is free. Yes, you read that correctly. For the basic functionality you can get the app for free. If you want to create and edit your own actions, choose your theme(s) and custom icon, use Workspaces, have access to enhanced URL automation and support development you can do so for $1.99 a month, or $19.99 a year. If you're not sure which you need then there is a 7 day trial to let you play with the pro features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macsparky.com/&quot;&gt;David Sparks (MacSparky)&lt;/a&gt; made a second video for Agile Tortoise showing what's new in version 5: &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/263948739&quot;&gt;Drafts 5: What's New&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Upgraded and Awesome Things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a brief overview of the new things, now onto everything else!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Widgets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drafts 4 had a widget, which allowed quick entry by default and if you enabled &quot;Show More&quot; (on the top right) allowed you to see the most recent Drafts. Drafts 5 has 3 widgets - one for quick entry, one for your recent items, and one for your workspaces. This allows you to enable and disable the ones you want on different devices, and with the workspaces go straight to the collection of Drafts you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-basic-widget.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-basic-widget.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-recent-widget-sizes.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-recent-widget-sizes.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-workspaces-widget-options.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-workspaces-widget-options.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Backup and Export&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your data is important, and there are backup options in Drafts which allow you to backup your drafts themselves, and/or your actions. These options were there before, but are now unified onto one screen. You can also export your drafts with the option to add a filter - so you could export all of your Drafts with the tag &quot;cake recipe&quot; if you wanted - for example to send them to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-backup-options.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-backup-options.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-export-drafts.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-export-drafts.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reminders Import&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminders import was present in version 4 too, but now you can add a tag when the reminders are imported - which is very helpful for filtering for them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/my-drafts-5-review/drafts5-reminders-import.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/04/drafts5-reminders-import.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;After Action Success&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setting used to be global which could be overridden on a per action basis. You can now set this option for each action group, and you can still override it for an action if you wish. This is extremely helpful for the keyboard action groups as you're unlikely to want most of those actions to archive or trash your Draft when use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drafts Forums&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile Tortoise have set up forums where Drafts users can talk to one another, help each other create actions, request features, and more - I've already signed up and am checking it regularly to see what I can learn from everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.getdrafts.com/&quot;&gt;Drafts Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using Drafts 5 instead of Drafts 4 for quite some time now, and I'm very happy with it. It has been my go to &quot;text starts here&quot; application ever since I bought it after hearing it mentioned on an episode of the Mac Power Users at some point - and it has become more than that over time. With the scripts and actions I can now write entire blog posts in Drafts, and could even upload them to the server and post them immediately if I wanted. This app has more than earnt it's position in my dock and will be there for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

I expect you all think of me as a power user, and I class myself in that category as well, but I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pleasantly surprised to find how many tricks I was missing on my iPhone! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you not familiar with a MacSparky field guide be prepared, this is not just a book. In fact, I would say it‚Äôs a &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; book - though without the singing. This book has videos embedded in it, over two hours of them where David demonstrates these features. The book is split into 44 chapters, and multiple sections within each chapter. A chapter tends to be an area such as Email, with sections being a look at the apps available. You even get tips and tricks such as how to use Fantastical's natural language parser to add an alert to an event when creating it, or which calculator application has an augmented reality mode in it. You can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macsparky.com/iphone&quot;&gt;full chapter list here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David‚Äôs done a great job here; the whole book is jam-packed full of knowledge - even for power users. I‚Äôm going to be buying a few copies for my family and best of all these tips and tricks can be used to enhance your iPad usage too. The only thing you should be aware of is that you'll most likely buy at least one app because of this book! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get your copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/id1366611031?at=1010lumu&quot;&gt;iPhone Field Guide&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current price is introductory so grab it while you can!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/workflow-clearing-out-your-camera-roll/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-clearing-out-your-camera-roll/workflow-clear-the-camera-roll.png&quot; alt=&quot;Clear The Camera Roll&quot;&gt; Sometimes you take screenshots, lots of screenshots. And sometimes you use built in screen recording to capture what's happening on a device. You probably use these features even more frequently if you‚Äôre beta testing an app - and that‚Äôs how this Workflow came to be. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/nostodnayr&quot;&gt;Ryan&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in the OmniFocus Beta Slack that his camera roll was suffering with all the screenshots he‚Äôs been taking. Challenge accepted. This workflow will help you delete &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;  screenshots and screencasts you‚Äôve taken on your devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Calculator.png&quot; alt=&quot;Number&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;: Set this number to be the number of screenshots and screencasts you want to go through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Photos.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Latest Screenshots&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Latest Screenshots&lt;/code&gt;:  This fetches the number of screenshots chosen above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose from List&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt;: You select which screenshots you want to delete. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Photos.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delete Photos&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Delete Photos&lt;/code&gt;: The photos are deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Videos.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Latest Videos&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Latest Videos&lt;/code&gt;: This gets X number of the most recent videos, X being the number right at the top of the Workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Repeat with Each&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Repeat with Each&lt;/code&gt;: It checks every picture.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Name&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;If&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;If&lt;/code&gt;: If the name of the photo contains &quot;Screen&quot;... (Screen recording videos are called something like &lt;code&gt;ScreenRecording_04-04-2018 15-17-54&lt;/code&gt;.)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Variable&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Variable&lt;/code&gt;: Get the actual video, otherwise you just have the name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add to Variable&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Add to Variable&lt;/code&gt;: Add the video to a variable called &lt;code&gt;Screen Recordings&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;If&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Else&lt;/code&gt;: It‚Äôa not got &quot;Screen&quot; in the name
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nothing&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;: We don‚Äôt want these videos to be included here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Get Variable&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Variable&lt;/code&gt;: Get all those screen recordings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose from List&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt;: Choose which screen recordings you want to delete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Photos.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delete Photos&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Delete Photos&lt;/code&gt;: Delete the screen recordings. We‚Äôre using this action rather than &quot;Delete Files&quot; because the Videos actions outputs a &quot;photo like object&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/workflow-podcast-show-notes/">&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple Workflow I use to get the show notes for the Mac Power Users podcast, I use it when I‚Äôm listening on another device and I don‚Äôt want to grab it or interrupt what I‚Äôm doing. It‚Äôs quite simple, just 3 steps in fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Steps:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scripting&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;: This asks you for the episode number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/URL.png&quot; alt=&quot;URL&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt; This creates the URL for the show notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Web.png&quot; alt=&quot;Web&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Open URLs&lt;/code&gt; And this opens the above URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the workflow here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/4cf72716fa3d4c79bdb36eccc9dabf13&quot;&gt;Mac Power Users Show Notes&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs designed to run in the today widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/workflow-podcast-show-notes/workflow-podcast-show-notes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Podcast Show Notes&quot;&gt; Now, you might listen to more than one podcast (&lt;code&gt;dramatic music&lt;/code&gt;) - and you probably don‚Äôt want one of these for every podcast you listen to, that‚Äôs just not manageable. But with some help from the dictionary action you can make it much easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Steps:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scripting&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt;: This is where you store the list of the friendly name for the podcast and the URL which comes before the show number, so in the case of the Mac Power Users podcast, that is &lt;code&gt;http://www.relay.fm/mpu/&lt;/code&gt; - attaching an episode number (such as 318) gives you a link directly to the show notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scripting&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask for Input&lt;/code&gt;:  This asks you for the episode number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Variable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Variable&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get Variable&lt;/code&gt;:  This grabs the dictionary from above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/workflow-icons/Scripting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scripting&quot; class=&quot;workflow-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose from List&lt;/code&gt;:  Here‚Äôs where you choose the podcast you‚Äôre listening to.&lt;/li&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/omnifocus-3-sneak-peak/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-temp-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-temp-logo.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I'm fortunate enough to have been let into the very early OmniFocus 3 Beta. The app isn't finished yet, but here are some of the features which you might enjoy. To make things clear, I have the dark theme on OF3, and the light theme in OF2 - and I've tried to do screenshots to let you compare the two easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Multi Pane Views&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now have a multipane view, this means you can have the traditional Home Screen on the left, tasks in the middle, and the inspector (detailed view of a task, project or tag) on the right - or you can have any combination of these three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-inspector-right-multiple-tags.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-inspector-right-multiple-tags.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-inspector-floating-sidebar-pinned.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-inspector-floating-sidebar-pinned.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-three-pane-view.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-three-pane-view.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forecast View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some changes to the Forecast view as well - primarily the interleaving of tasks and calendar events. This is purely based on the due time of a task and the time of the calendar event.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-today-view.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-today-view.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-2-today-view.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-2-today-view.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-forecast-view-iphone.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-forecast-view-iphone.png&quot; width=&quot;423&quot; height=&quot;916&quot; /&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-2-forecast-view-iphone.png&quot; width=&quot;422&quot; height=&quot;913&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new feature is the ability to have &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; tag displayed in the forecast view. This might be very handy if you have lots of &lt;code&gt;#waiting on&lt;/code&gt; tasks which you need to be on top of, or if there's a particular area you need to focus on. Of course, if you want multiple tags that's what perspectives are for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/showing-tags-in-the-today-view.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/showing-tags-in-the-today-view.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Inspector&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-customising-the-inspector.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-customising-the-inspector.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;304&quot; height=&quot;856&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The inspector for tasks, tags, and projects has received some updates. You can set what you want to see and hide by default - so if you never use locations in tags (or contexts as they are in OF2) you can hide them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Project Inspector&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/project-inspector-default.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/project-inspector-default.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/project-inspector-default-extended.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/project-inspector-default-extended.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/customising-the-project-inspector.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/customising-the-project-inspector.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;649&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Tag Inspector&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/tag-inspector-default.png??lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/tag-inspector-default.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;649&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/tag-inspector-default-extended.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/tag-inspector-default-extended.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/customising-the-tag-inspector.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/customising-the-tag-inspector.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;649&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Task Inspector&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/task-inspector-default.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/task-inspector-default.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;649&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/task-inspector-default-extended.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/task-inspector-default-extended.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/customising-the-task-inspector.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/customising-the-task-inspector.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;649&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course these changes are present on the iPad as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search can now happen from any view, just by pulling down on the tasks list. Previously it was in the bar at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-search-in-any-view.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-search-in-any-view.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-2-search.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-2-search.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Location Based Notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notifications have had some changes made to them as well. Here on the top you see OmniFocus 3, and below it you see OmniFocus 2. Omnifocus 2 shows you the name of the context, the first task, and the number of other tasks available. OmniFocus 3 shows you the name of the tag, and how many tasks are available to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-iphone-notifications.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-iphone-notifications.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The watch notifications are exactly the same. At first glance this seems like it is less information - but force touching or 3D touching the notification (depending on which device you're on) gives us a lot more choice.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OmniFocus 3 here lets me View Location, or View Actions. OmniFocus 2 lets me dismiss the notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-watch-notification-detail.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-watch-notification-detail.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-2-watch-notification-detail.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notifications have had an overhaul - gone are the days where you get pinged as something goes from &quot;hell being about to break loose&quot; to &quot;apocalypse&quot;, you can now set up a series of notifications for a task. If your task has a due date you can set reminders to happen X amount of time before it becomes due by adding minutes, hours, or days. Whether or not your task has a due date you can set a custom or fixed notification which will happen at the date and time you specify - very helpful. These notifications are one off, but the customisability is definitely something I'll be using frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-reminders-for-tasks.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-reminders-for-tasks.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;649&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-before-due-notifications.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-before-due-notifications.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-fixed-notification.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-fixed-notification.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flagging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A task or project is flagged or isn't flagged. A task can inherit a tag from the project or task it belongs to - and none of this has changed in OmniFocus 3. What has changed is how you tag things. You can simply swipe from left to right on a task or project, and tap to flag it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-quick-flagging-and-unflagging-tasks.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-quick-flagging-and-unflagging-tasks.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see very easily when a task is flagged because its parent is flagged which is very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/parent-is-flagged.jpeg?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/parent-is-flagged.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick Editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So swiping from left to right lets you flag or unflag, swiping in the other direction allows you to delete the task, or if you tap more you can schedule it - for today or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-swipe-to-delete.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-swipe-to-delete.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/OmniFocus-3-sneak-peak/omnifocus-3-quick-schedule.png?lightbox=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/assets/2018/03/omnifocus-3-quick-schedule.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Batch Task Editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's now possible to edit multiple tasks at once as well - this is hard to explain in screenshots so I've created a very short video for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/CZhEAUf5jKM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise, I absolutely love the beta of OmniFocus 3. There are things planned for this iOS app which haven't yet arrived, and many exciting new possibilities. I'm going to really have to dig into tags to see mysq&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note about the icon:&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/tile-finding-the-things-i-lose/">&lt;p&gt;I am a forgetful person, not necessarily disorganised, but forgetful. And the more I have to do the more forgetful I tend to be - which results in things like misplaced keys, purses, ID cards - and naturally at the most inconvenient of moments. I heard about &lt;a href=&quot;http://ssqt.co/mEdevMh&quot;&gt;Tile&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago, but the thought of not being able to replace the battery or recharge the device seemed wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, KeySmart, a company who makes Swiss army style covers for keys, came out with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getkeysmart.com/products/keysmart-pro-with-tile-smart-location-tracking&quot;&gt;KeySmart Pro&lt;/a&gt; - which has built in Tile technology, and a micro USB port. So now once every 2 months or so I need to charge my keys, but when I misplace them I can open the app on my phone, and make them ring. I‚Äôbe had this since November, and actually ordered two as I have the keys to my parents house - which I don‚Äôt need the vast majority of the time, so am more likely to misplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/tile-finding-the-things-i-lose/KeySmart-pro-charging.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;KeySmart Pro on charge&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while of having the ability to find my keys (though summoning them Harry Potter style is not yet possible, sadly) I realised that being able to locate my work ID and keys, or my purse would also be handy. This week I picked up a set of the Tile Mate and Slim. The slim is about the thickness of 2 credit cards, and the same height as one, I put one in my passport holder, and another in my purse (having managed to pack my purse in my checked luggage and spending an hour looking for it last week really pushed me here!). The Tile Mates will go on my work keys once I get home, and then I have a spare - purpose to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/tile-finding-the-things-i-lose/tile-mate-slim.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Tile Mate and Slim, dollar bill and purse for scale&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the deciding factors for me when getting my first Tile though, was a story of a woman in Australia who had lost her keys. She marked them as lost in the TIle app and a few months later got a push notification that they had been found - someone had walked past the lost property area where her keys were and the Tile app on their device registered that her keys were present. While this &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; creepy, you can‚Äôt see anyone else‚Äôs devices unless they choose to share them with you - so your phone scans for the locations, and reports them back to Tile, but you don‚Äôt ever see the data yourself. The brilliance of this is helping others - maybe today I have all of my possessions where I expect them to be, but if/when I misplace one of my things it‚Äôs comforting to know that other people are helping me look, and they don‚Äôt have to lift a finger to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of Tile are simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will recycle dead devices and give you a voucher towards your next Tile, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/200550678-What-is-reTile-&quot;&gt;ReTile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There‚Äôs a large network of users, which means if you can‚Äôt find your propery then maybe someone else can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The KeySmart Pro is rechargeable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there are some disadvantages to Tile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can‚Äôt recharge most of their devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The white does discolour, depending on where you keep your items and how much you handle them this may be quick or slow, but the white will probably turn grey sooner or later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no notifications for leaving something behind. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, for me the advantages well outweigh the disadvantages - and I‚Äôm very happy with my new system. I use my Apple Watch to ping my iPhone, and my iPhone to ping whatever is missing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/">&lt;p&gt;00&amp;amp;classes=image-right &quot;Apple Store Vienna, Grand Opening&quot;) The first Apple Store in Austria opened today, and it happened to be the 501st Apple Store. I attended the opening and was lucky enough not to be too far back in the line - lots of people seem to have arrived before midnight, including one man from China who arrived at 2pm the day before! At it was cold I &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; got there at 7am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This store matches Apple's new style with plants indoors, but they're using Genius tables and the grove is outside. All of the employees were there today and seemed to be really enjoying it - everyone I spoke to was enthusiastic and friendly, a few looked a little overwhelmed but that is to be expected!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Day Before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpgeg?&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpgeg?&lt;/a&gt; &quot;The first person in line - from 2pm the day before&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Opening Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the store the queue was just going past the end of the barrier. Due to the width of the street and the fact that it can be used for delivery vehicles Apple had prepared further waiting areas towards the other side of the street. The few of us tailing past the end of the ropes were asked to move to the middle and remain in order. Once that area filled up they moved on to the next and further on. Of course this meant there were lots of people milling around between the queues - but Apple had thought of that. When each queue was allowed to progress to the next one every person was given a card. You had to show this to enter the next queue, and then hand it over when exiting the queue or just before entering the store. This was a very simple but efficient system and prevented queue jumping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the security managing the queues were multi lingual and friendly enough to allow you to make a quick bathroom or coffee run - assuming the people standing next to you in the queue were happy to hold your spot that was, they did stop allowing that at 9am though (30 minutes before the store opened). While we were in the queue four employees came through to photograph everyone and get permission to use your photo in their marketing material. If you didn't want to be featured they did request permission to take a photo anyway so they could work on an exclusion basis rather than an inclusion basis. At around 8:30am staff brought out coffee for people in the queue which was very much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpgeg?&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/apple_store_opening_vienna/Vienna_Apple_Store_Opening.jpgeg?&lt;/a&gt; &quot;There are just two lines allowed next to the Apple Store&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Postcards and a pin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving out t-shirts we were given postcards and a commemorative pin. The postcards are on lovely thick, cream card stock, and the design is raised on the front with a slight gloss. I've scanned them in to show you - but the designs do belong to Apple. These images are animated and shown on the screen at the back of the store on the ground floor.&lt;/p&gt;

It has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/&quot;&gt;7&quot; touchscreen display&lt;/a&gt; attached which is lovely - but bright. I prefer to turn the screen on and off when I want to use it instead of relying on the energy saver preferences (as I inevitably use the device just before I want to sleep) - however typing the terminal commands to do it is rather old fashioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &quot;Dictionary of actions in Workflow&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first action is a dictionary - so every ssh command I run has a name which I look at when running the Workflow. You can have anything here of course - providing it's a valid SSH command. My commands are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo bash -c &quot;echo 0 &amp;gt; /sys/class/backlight/rpi_backlight/bl_power&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo bash -c &quot;echo 1 &amp;gt; /sys/class/backlight/rpi_backlight/bl_power&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restart HomeBridge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl restart homebridge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restart HomeAssistant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl restart home-assistant@homeassistant&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Workflow asks you to choose an action to execute, and executes it. Finally you see the result of the SSH command returned to you - which is useful if there is output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/bfd213edebfd4f9597cad6150a586e08&quot;&gt;download the Workflow here&lt;/a&gt;. You'll need to know the IP address of your Raspberry Pi, the username (default &lt;code&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt;), and password (default &lt;code&gt;raspberry&lt;/code&gt;). If your username and password are the default ones I recommend you change them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/good-morning-computer/">&lt;p&gt;A while ago in the Mac Power Users Facebook Group I was challenged to make a Workflow which would tell the user about their upcoming day. When it runs Workflow will say something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good morning Rose, it is 07:38.&lt;br /&gt;
In Vienna the weather will be mixed precipitation throughout the week, with temperatures rising to 6¬∞C on Friday..&lt;br /&gt;
The current temperature is 0 degrees celcius.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a 11% chance of rain.&lt;br /&gt;
Your iPad has 80% battery.&lt;br /&gt;
Your calendar events for today are Shrove Tuesday, Work.&lt;br /&gt;
The top news headlines for today are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is some of your favourite music:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it speaks this it then plays some of my favourite music (shuffling from a playlist I chose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how does this all work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you import the Workflow it asks you three questions, what you name is, your Dark Sky Weather API, and the RSS feed of your favourite news source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/good-morning-computer/workflow_import_questions.png&quot;&gt;https://resources.rosemaryorchard.com/images/blog/good-morning-computer/workflow_import_questions.png&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get your &lt;a href=&quot;https://darksky.net/dev/docs&quot;&gt;API Key from Dark Sky&lt;/a&gt;, on the free plan you get up to 1000 calls per day - more than enough for our Workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the Workflow gets the data we need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the titles of the last 6 items from the RSS feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current location and the name of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the weather for your current location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the kind of device you're using&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the battery level of the device you're using&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your calendar events for today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this information is inserted into the text, let's look at that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good morning &lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt;, it is &lt;strong&gt;Current Time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;strong&gt;City&lt;/strong&gt; the weather will be &lt;strong&gt;Weather Summary&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The current temperature is &lt;strong&gt;Temperature degrees celcius&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a &lt;strong&gt;Rain %&lt;/strong&gt;% chance of rain.&lt;br /&gt;
Your &lt;strong&gt;Device Model&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;strong&gt;Battery Level&lt;/strong&gt;% battery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Calendar Events.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The top news headlines for today are &lt;strong&gt;Headlines&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is some of your favourite music:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in bold is a variable, replaced with data we either fetched from the internet, or collected from the device. After this text all that Workflow has to do is use the speak text action, and the play music action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two current versions of the Workflow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/94ba7b07407948bdbabccfdb4c1d63fa&quot;&gt;an imperial version for those who prefer Farenheit&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/c9964e848eee49c6a3b4290f00338322&quot;&gt;metric version for those who prefer Celsius&lt;/a&gt;. If you download either of these you can have your device talk to you in the morning, and tell you about your day.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/creating_my_own_raspberry_pi_homekit_controlled_light</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/creating_my_own_raspberry_pi_homekit_controlled_light/">&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mood-light-pi-zero-w-project-kit&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi Zero W mood light kit&lt;/a&gt; on Pimoroni. I've been looking for a project to practice my python and thought playing with lights would be fun. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/assembling-mood-light&quot;&gt;assembling said light&lt;/a&gt; (I recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/gpio-hammer-header&quot;&gt;solderless set&lt;/a&gt; by the way, unless you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like soldering) and playing with it, I wanted to control it along with the Philips Hue lights which are around my desk - via HomeKit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pimoroni has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/using-mote-with-homekit-and-siri&quot;&gt;guide to set up Mote lights via HomeKit&lt;/a&gt;, so with some tweaking I got it running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-unicorn-phat&quot;&gt;install the software&lt;/a&gt; first. Then I had to modify their code - I don't have Mote lights, but I have the Unicorn pHAT. So instead of importing &lt;code&gt;mote&lt;/code&gt; I had to import &lt;code&gt;unicornhat&lt;/code&gt;, and very importantly I had to change the dimension of the lights - if you try to set lights that don't exist on the unicorn pHAT then it won't work. Despite doing this I had some problems with floats being returned instead of integers, so I changed all the division to use &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; which resolved that issue nicely. Here's the code for the API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python
from colorsys import hsv_to_rgb, rgb_to_hsv
import unicornhat as unicorn
from flask import Flask, jsonify, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)
unicorn.set_layhout(unicorn.PHAT)
unicorn.brightness(0.5)
width, height = unicorn.get_shape()

colour = 'FFFFFF'
status = 0

def hex_to_rgb(value):
    value = value.lstrip('#')
    length = len(value)
    return tuple(int(value[i:i + length // 3], 16) for i in range(0, length, length // 3))

def unicorn_on(c):
    r, g, b = hex_to_rgb(c)
    for channel in range(width):
        for pixel in range(height):
            unicorn.set_pixel(channel, pixel, int(r), int(g), int(b))
    unicorn.show()
    return True

def unicorn_off():
    unicorn.clear()
    unicorn.show()
    return True

def get_status():
    global status
    for channel in range(width):
        for pixel in range(height):
            if unicorn.get_pixel(channel, pixel) != (0, 0, 0):
                status = 1
    return status

@app.route('/unicorn/api/v1.0/&amp;lt;string:st&amp;gt;', methods=['GET'])
def set_status(st):
    global status, colour
    if st == 'on':
        status = 1
        unicorn_on(colour)
    elif st == 'off':
        status = 0
        unicorn_off()
    elif st == 'status':
        status = get_status()
    return jsonify({'status': status, 'colour': colour})

@app.route('/unicorn/api/v1.0/set', methods=['GET'])
def get_colour():
    global colour
    return jsonify({'status': status, 'colour': colour})

@app.route('/unicorn/api/v1.0/set/&amp;lt;string:c&amp;gt;', methods=['GET'])
def set_colour(c):
    global status, colour
    colour = c
    if status != 0:
        unicorn_on(colour)
        status = 1
    return jsonify({'status': status, 'colour': colour})

@app.errorhandler(404)
def not_found(error):
    return make_response(jsonify({'error': 'Not found'}), 404)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unicorn_off()
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I can't claim any credit here, I just modified their example to work for the unicorn pHAT instead of Mote.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I had to add the light to my HomeBridge installation. I ran &lt;code&gt;sudo npm install -g homebridge-better-http-rgb&lt;/code&gt;, added the following configuration and restarted HomeBridge. Make sure to replace the IP address with your light, or with &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; if you're running HomeBridge on the same machine as your light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    {
          &quot;accessory&quot;: &quot;HTTP-RGB&quot;,
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MoodLight&quot;,

          &quot;switch&quot;: {
              &quot;status&quot;: &quot;http://10.0.0.116:5000/unicorn/api/v1.0/status&quot;,
              &quot;powerOn&quot;: &quot;http://10.0.0.116:5000/unicorn/api/v1.0/on&quot;,
              &quot;powerOff&quot;: &quot;http://10.0.0.116:5000/unicorn/api/v1.0/off&quot;
          },

          &quot;brightness&quot;: {
              &quot;status&quot;: &quot;http://10.0.0.116:5000/unicorn/api/v1.0/brightness&quot;,
              &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://10.0.0.116:5000/unicorn/api/v1.0/brightness/%s&quot;
          },

          &quot;color&quot;: {
              &quot;status&quot;: &quot;http://10.0.0.116:5000/unicorn/api/v1.0/set&quot;,
              &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://10.0.0.116:5000/unicorn/api/v1.0/set/%s&quot;,
              &quot;brightness&quot;: true
          }
      }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a video of the light in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't fault a company for cutting products which aren't money makers - but the App Store needs to change so that apps like these become money makers. Is it a niche product? Yes. Is it rock solid and high quality? Definitely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't stop using Transmit right away - I will look out for other products and if I find a good alternative I'll switch. I just hope whatever it is has Workflow integration like Transmit did.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;I have to agree, I did not &quot;get&quot; how to purchase apps to start with (one of the first things I did with my iPhone X), once I knew how to do it then it was obvious - so I would guess the physical action came first and the animation later, when everyone testing it knew how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <title type="html">AirPods - A Year On</title>
	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/airpods-a-year-on/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AirPods - A Year On" />
	  <published>2018-01-02T08:00:00+00:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/airpods-a-year-on</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/airpods-a-year-on/">&lt;p&gt;Just over a year ago I walked into the Apple Store and picked up my AirPods - I was lucky enough to get a pair on launch day, but wasn't really sure if I'd like them. Over the next few days I got used to them and found that unlike EarPods they didn't cause my ears to ache - or constantly fall out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later I use my AirPods most of the time without thinking about it. They have become something I take with me almost everywhere without thinking about it. From my smallest handbag, to the side of the pool, to flights across the Atlantic Ocean they have gone on every trip I've made. They're not perfect - if they had noise cancelling built in then I would use them even more instead of getting my over ear headphones out to block loud conversations and screaming children. But if I'm commuting to work these are what I reach for - and they're wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of iOS 11 you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2017/07/12/ios-11-how-to-customize-airpods-controls/&quot;&gt;customise the controls on the AirPods&lt;/a&gt; independently of one another. I set my right ear to play/pause, and the left ear to skip the track. I rarely use the play/pause option to be honest - removing an AirPod is usually what I do, and the auto resume when you put it back in your ear has been flawless for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for my AirPods is showing a few marks and dents where it has slipped out of my hand onto the pavement a few times, however as Apple have said they will be selling a case with Qi charging built in I'm not too worried - the Qi charging will allow me to top up the case regularly without really thinking about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love my AirPods - a lot more than I thought I would.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/creating-rich-contacts-on-ios/">&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered a little trick from the Map app in iOS - that you can add a rich contact to your contact, complete with map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. The first step is finding the place on the map - Apple Maps has got much better over the years so points of interest and useful places like doctors surgeries are often searchable by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?resize=400)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Then you need to choose to either add a new contact, or add this information to an existing contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?resize=200)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?resize=400)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Once this is done you have an enhanced contact - complete with mini map, and any other information that is attached to that place in Maps - so here we have opening hours and more.&lt;/p&gt;

	  <title type="html">Airmail Custom Actions</title>
	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/airmail-custom-actions/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Airmail Custom Actions" />
	  <published>2017-07-19T08:00:00+01:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
	  <id>https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/airmail-custom-actions</id>
	  
	  
		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/airmail-custom-actions/">&lt;p&gt;I've been experimenting more with &lt;a href=&quot;http://airmailapp.com&quot;&gt;Airmail&lt;/a&gt; on iOS recently, specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.airmailapp.com/airmail-for-ios/custom-actions-airmail-for-iphone&quot;&gt;custom actions&lt;/a&gt;. Being a regular user of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rosemaryorchard.com/blog/tag:workflow&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt; I'm very familiar with the concept - but Airmail does things a little differently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://airmailapp.com/ios&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started with the custom actions you first need to enable integration with the apps you want to work with - for me this is primarily OmniFocus and Workflow, but not exclusively, this is done in the Services section - and there's everything from Dropbox to Instapaper, and even GitHub.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is the purpose of an action? An Airmail action allows you to chain multiple steps together - these can be purely email steps (e.g. forward an email, add a label, archive it), or involving external applications. I'll go through some of mine for you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Receipts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I prefer to handle receipts as PDFs on my Mac - or to be precise, I let Hazel handle my receipts on my Mac. This means I need to get my receipts to somewhere on my Mac Hazel is watching. I have a Workflow which I usually share a PDF directly to - and Airmail has an option to share the message as a PDF to Workflow, along with a whole host of other options.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only catch is that Airmail shares a link to the PDF - but it can override the choice you previously made in Workflow to only accept certain document types. As such I added an If - and if the input is a URL I get the contents of it, and then have Workflow file the receipt in my chosen folder in Dropbox. You can get my &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/3b0ca2be8e614dd19f5c48ad7e5e7dcc&quot;&gt;Web Receipts Workflow here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the receipt has been saved as a PDF and filed I have Airmail delete the Workflow and that's it! One less email in my inbox.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Travel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripit.com&quot;&gt;TripIt&lt;/a&gt; to organise my travel - and TripIt is very good at parsing booking emails for the right data. While they do have an option to scan your inbox, I get enough bookings forwarded to me from my family and friends that this isn't a great option - otherwise I'd be in two places at once and permanently on holiday! (Unless I did a lot of manual management in Tripit.) My preferred solution then is to forward emails to TripIt myself - I then apply my travel label and archive the message. With this custom action I just have to confirm the forwarding of the message and Airmail does the rest for me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waiting On&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Waiting on is used a lot in &lt;a href=&quot;http://gettingthingsdone.com&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt;, essentially it's a list of things you're waiting on other people for - simple enough. However most of my waiting on 'tasks' come via my email inbox. I send Workflow the title and the link to the email, have it parse that and then add the resulting task to OmniFocus. You can get my &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/a34e6dbcbb1a4e008a8d751d5dfd69ad&quot;&gt;Airmail Waiting On Workflow here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Link to Clipboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Airmail actually has a built in action for this, but I use it in parts of other custom actions and it's very handy to know how to get a link to an email as part of a custom action. All I do is use the Workflow action to send the mail link to a Workflow called &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/7c537bb994a7486a8ee0dd6b895af03d&quot;&gt;Copy to Clipboard&lt;/a&gt; which has exactly one action - it takes whatever the input is and copies it to my clipboard. (I have this purely for the times when something is being difficult and the copy button is either not available or not working because I'm running a beta iOS).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Track Deliveries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last for now is Track Delivieries, I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://appsto.re/gb/DGbwr.i&quot;&gt;Deliveries App by Junecloud&lt;/a&gt;, and Airmail can either share a message to it directly, or as part of a custom action. I start by sharing to Deliveries, then use my Waiting On workflow from above, add an extra label of packages, and then archive the message. This way I can track my package, as well as see in OmniFocus I'm waiting on something.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <title type="html">WWDC Keynote Games</title>
	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/wwdc-keynote-games/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="WWDC Keynote Games" />

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/wwdc-keynote-games/">&lt;p&gt;Today is the day, Apple fans are perhaps a little too excited but that's par for the course. We've had plenty of &quot;pre-announcements&quot; and speculation that these have come over the last week because they're running short of time in the Keynote. There's even been an apparent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6ezhwm/iama_foxconn_insider_with_information_on_next_12/&quot;&gt;supply chain leak&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit (and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6f21c7/everything_ufoxconninsider_reported_today/&quot;&gt;handy summary&lt;/a&gt; if you don't feel like wading through all those comments).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are a few WWDC games you can play along with during the keynote (useful if it's 3am your time and you're tired!), so I made a short roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/143&quot;&gt;Upgrade #143&lt;/a&gt;: Myke or Jason? Who gets more points? There's a PDF scorecard in the comments, and you can listen to their episode afterwards discussing the event and dishing out scores (they have an independent judge incase they can't agree!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6f7dkr/for_the_first_time_in_2017_back_again_its_apple/?st=J3IRCB7T&amp;amp;sh=4a5baabf&quot;&gt;WWDC 2017 Keynote Bingo&lt;/a&gt;: From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMechanoids&quot;&gt;/u/TheMechanoids&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit. I appreciate the fact that &quot;one more thing...&quot; is right in the middle - and I hope we get a full house!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/connected/144&quot;&gt;Connected #144&lt;/a&gt;: Federico, Stephen and Myke decided not to score but to decide who would be happier, Federico suggested the Happy-o-meter, and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rosemaryorchard/status/869961982740398080&quot;&gt;threw one together&lt;/a&gt;, there was a positive reaction on Twitter so &lt;a href=&quot;Connected_Happy-o-meter.pdf&quot;&gt;here it is in PDF&lt;/a&gt; for you if you prefer that to an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun, and remember - even if you don't get what you thought you wanted you might well get something much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally I've even thrown a WWDC 2017 wallpaper on my watch ;) (Wallpaper available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macerkopf.de/2017/02/22/wwdc-2017-wallpaper-hintergrundbilder-als-download/&quot;&gt;macerkopf.de&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you're planning on installing the developer betas don't forget to do an encrypted backup first.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-ipad-wishes-and-concept-video&quot;&gt;MacStories&lt;/a&gt;'s Federico Viticci along with Sam Beckett did a brilliant video of an iOS 11 concept - I especially like the Shelf, it feels very Apple like and I could see myself using it a lot.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/143&quot;&gt;The Upgrade WWDC Keynote Draft&lt;/a&gt; had Myke and Jason make 10 picks each that they think or hope will happen - I'm looking forward to the post-keynote scoring episode! I'm also crossing my fingers for another #mykewasright and that a 10.5&quot; iPad Pro is announced - as much as I love my 12.9&quot;, if the iPad Mini is indeed dead I would like to consolidate to one device and 12.9&quot; is too large whilst the 9.7&quot; is too small really.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/canvas/36&quot;&gt;Canvas made wishes&lt;/a&gt;, Federico and Fraser got Merlin Mann on as a guest (making the episode even more fun) - Fraser and Merlin made an excellent suggestion that it would be good if you could find apps you've not used in a long time or which haven't been updated for a while. We currently have the ability to find the 32 Bit apps (under Settings &amp;gt; General&amp;gt; About &amp;gt; Applications), but that alone isn't that helpful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bye bye to Pirates!&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joe-steel.com/2017-05-26-WWDC-2017-Wish-List-tvOS.html&quot;&gt;Joe Steel&lt;/a&gt; made some excellent comments on tvOS. I particularly like the picture in picture suggestion, and the change away from the Rolodex view.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with all of the above, I have a few of my own wishes:    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would really like them to Sherlock &lt;a href=&quot;http://eternalstorms.at/yoink/Yoink_-_Simplify_and_Improve_Drag_and_Drop_on_your_Mac/Yoink_-_Simplify_drag_and_drop_on_your_Mac.html&quot;&gt;Yoink&lt;/a&gt; - it's a great concept and I love it. Unfortunately my parents and many less technical folk don't see the point of paying for things like this when they can do it the more difficult way for free.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPad Splitscreen improvements - basically the current system is only workable if you spend a lot of time making it work. For a machine to be ideal it needs to work for you - and right now I'm working for it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to set default contact methods for different contacts. I have friends in multiple countries, if I want to call them I am almost never going to use the phone app - it'll be via FaceTime, WhatsApp, Telegram or Skype. Currently I have to remember which method I use and use it specifically.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;watchOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More flexible watch faces. I would like to have a few completely customisable faces, think of a modular face with 9 boxes, you can choose to merge any boxes next to each other - allowing you to make complications of various sizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;tvOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding local media storage and apps like Infuse to the TV app. I have all this content, but I need to visit multiple different apps to find all my content.    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of which: the TV app needs to be available outside of the USA/North America.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;siriOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get it, Siri isn't an operating system. But it would be good if Siri could work (mostly) the same way across all platforms. I can't create a note on my watch - but I can on my phone. Consistency, and a shared brain would be excellent. Not needing to set up who my family is on every device would be a good start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/json-feed/">&lt;p&gt;Everyone's been talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsonfeed.org&quot; title=&quot;JSON Feed&quot;&gt;JSON feed&lt;/a&gt; recently, or at least that's how it seems! As said by &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/17/json-feed&quot; title=&quot;John Gruber at Daring Fireball&quot;&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt;, it's written for real humans. JSON is everywhere nowadays, and it's very easy to parse! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such I thought it would be nice to implement JSON feed here on this blog. Unfortunately there isn't yet a JSON feed plugin for &lt;a href=&quot;https://getgrav.org&quot; title=&quot;Grav, Content Management System&quot;&gt;Grav&lt;/a&gt;, however there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-feed&quot; title=&quot;Grav Feed Plugin&quot;&gt;feed plugin&lt;/a&gt; - which I was already using to provide RSS. As such I decided to do a bit of playing with it, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-feed/pull/21&quot; title=&quot;My GitHub pull requests for Grav Feed Plugin&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; or two later there will be a JSON feed! In the mean time I've already implemented it locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just for fun, I made a workflow where you can read JSON feeds: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/527a5cac66ee40ce9899b642cf84eb94&quot; title=&quot;JSON Feed Reader Workflow&quot;&gt;JSON Feed Reader&lt;/a&gt;, to keep the Workflow from getting too long (and because it was just a proof of concept), the article you select is opened in the in app Safari window and there's no tracking which articles you have or haven't read.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/migrating-wunderlist-to-trello/">&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/19/microsoft-to-shut-down-wunderlist-in-favor-of-its-new-app-to-do/&quot;&gt;Wunderlist is sadly shutting down&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that I would move before I was pushed - so after some evaluation of my uses (shared lists primarily, and nothing that would end up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rosemaryorchard.com/blog/tag:omnifocus&quot;&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;) I decided on &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/roseorchard/recommend&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;. They have optional Trello Gold which means I can pay them and make them more likely to stick around - ideal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was the challenge: &quot;how do I move my data from Wunderlist to Trello?&quot;. There are a few paid tools out there, but as much as I'm happy to pay for a good service - I do love free! As such I decided to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step was exporting all of my data from Wunderlist. Inside of the Wunderlist web app, inside of your account settings you can create a backup. Unfortunately this brought me to my first problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that Wunderlist doesn't play nicely with Safari, but giving me a file called &quot;Unknown&quot; with no extension wasn't very nice either way. Thankfully a quick Google told me that this is in JSON format and so I renamed it, and put it in my Workflow folder in iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That done it was time to get started! The first thing to do was to poke around at the data and see what it was like. Workflow's &quot;Get Dictionary from Input&quot; was immensely helpful here, and I quickly managed to isolate the lists and tasks. I ended up creating two Workflows here, one which turns each Wunderlist list into a board, with a list - both of which have the name of the Wunderlist list, and then one which fetches all the tasks and puts them onto said list on the correct board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/f1f2ce60833b4f8597d39c6a9e72b321&quot;&gt;Wunderlist to Trello Boards and Lists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/e37a39a91c194782bbe56a5519d621ac&quot;&gt;Wunderlist To Trello Tasks&lt;/a&gt; are the two Workflows here - I separated them to allow you to modify them separately more easily. Simply run the first one, and then the second one and off you go!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	  <link href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/charging-tech-while-travelling/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Charging Tech While Travelling" />
	  <published>2017-03-08T08:00:00+00:00</published>
	  <updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/charging-tech-while-travelling/">&lt;p&gt;Whenever you're on the go you always seem to end up needing to charge more gadgets simultaneously than at home - or at least you do if you're me. Along with the standard devices there are backup battery packs, and of course, if there are any long journeys you want everything fully charged before you depart! One handy little thing I've been carrying in my travel bag for over a year now is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mstaYN&quot;&gt;AUKEY 5-Port USB Charger&lt;/a&gt;. As the name implies it has 5 ports, and each of them should charger at 10A (the power of the old iPad chargers). While it's not perfect - it certainly won't charge my massive 12.9&quot; iPad Pro in a hurry, it's more than good enough for nearly everything else. I can charge my phone, both iPads, headphones and a battery pack simultaneously - and if I plug in the behemoth of the iPad Pro overnight it'll be 100% come morning too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mstaYN&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of this though, at least for me, is that it uses a standard figure of eight lead - the same ones used on Apple's Airport range, the Mac Mini and the Apple TV - plus a plethora of other gadgets. This means you can buy alternative cables easily. As it's 110V-240V it will work around the world, all you need to do is plug it in. I personally prefer having different cables to take with me vs a regular cable and an adaptor - it takes up less space. Additionally in some places I visit frequently, I have a spare cable there - just to reduce on packing a little. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this isn't the only charging solution I carry. As mentioned above I have battery packs, and as well as that I have the 29W USB C charger from Apple with the Lightning to USB C cable, and a standard Apple iPhone charger. These come in handy when plugs are inconveniently placed, more gadgets need charging, or I need to use my iPad Pro whilst charging it (it usually maintains battery life on the Aukey charger, but it certainly won't increase). Both Apple chargers are also ideal for use on a plane which has a charging socket too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that at some point soon Anker will come out with a charging block with a well powered USB C port on it which will allow me to ditch the 29W adapter when travelling at least.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/tracking-exchange-rates-when-travelling/">&lt;p&gt;I've recently been travelling a lot (which as my family is well aware, is a normal state!) and wanted to be able to easily keep track of the exchange rate, plus be able to calculate the prices including tax - as well as find out how much it would be in my normal currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1 was finding an API I could use. I'm a big fan of free - and when that's nor possible affordable. Naturally &lt;a href=&quot;http://xe.com&quot;&gt;XE Currency&lt;/a&gt; was my first port of call but that was a little out of my price range. A little Googling found &lt;a href=&quot;http://fixer.io&quot;&gt;Fixer.io&lt;/a&gt; which is free, and while not giving the identical rates to xe.com or my card company, close enough to give me a very good approximation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was creating a Workflow which would get me the current exchange rate, and save it to a file so I could use it offline. A simple GET command and some RegEx was all that was needed to extract the exchange rate, then it was a simple matter of saving the file for later retrieval - and I added an alert at the end.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/philofaxy-podcast-appearance/">&lt;p&gt;This week I was a guest on the Philofaxy podcast, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Plannerverse - Episode 51. I had a great time talking to Steve (as always!), as we delved into how I plan and my systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We touched on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First encounters with planners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parental influence on planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current style of planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work Planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I like most about paper planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/workflow-daily-dark-sky-weather/">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been exploring APIs quite a bit recently and came across the &lt;a href=&quot;https://darksky.net/dev/docs&quot;&gt;Dark Sky API&lt;/a&gt; (free for up to 1000 calls a day). The possibilities with this API, like most, are many - and my immediate thought was I could use it to tell me at the start of the day what the weather will be like for the day - regardless of where I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve experimented with IFTTT to tell me automatically at X time, but the problem with IFTTT is your location is static - you have to log into the website every time you need to change it. It also tells me at the same time &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; day and my schedule can vary somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to the Workflow! I wanted to get the max and min temperature for the day, plus humidity and a rough summary of the next few days, all of these are possible in the API. I also decided that regardless of where I am in the world I would like the units to be metric (standard international, to be precise). I explored the &lt;a href=&quot;https://darksky.net/dev/docs/forecast&quot;&gt;very thorough API documentation&lt;/a&gt; and realised I could exclude current, minute, hourly, alerts and flags data, and did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the Workflow: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/f820044097a9467a8879795058e0f887&quot;&gt;Daily Dark Sky Forecast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/f820044097a9467a8879795058e0f887&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a today widget, it will likely take a little while to run as it gets your GPS location - if you don‚Äôt travel much or at all then it might be worth finding out your latitude and longitude and hard coding them in. The emojis in the top dictionary can be modified of course - they're just there to represent the icon which is available in the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you like Dark Sky it's well worth buying the app!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
