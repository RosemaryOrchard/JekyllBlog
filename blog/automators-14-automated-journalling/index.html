  Episode 14 of Automators is all about journalling - when David suggested the
  topic for this episode I jumped on it. I subscribed to Day One last year and
  have been trying to improve my usage of it, this episode forced me to go
  figure out some automations to make it easier - thankfully since recording
  I've been journalling more consistently than ever!

  David made a short video breaking down how he does some of his automations
  too. I hope you enjoy the episode!
