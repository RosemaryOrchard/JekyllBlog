  In episode 5 of Nested Folders Scotty and I dived into our weekly review
  routines. It was also good to review traps we've both previously fallen into
  with our reviews - I've been considering making a printed list of how I do my
  weekly review and if I do so I'm also going to make a list of "not to do" on
  it - as a reminder of those lessons that I've learned over the years!
