<p>Everyone's been talking about <a href="https://jsonfeed.org" title="JSON Feed">JSON feed</a> recently, or at least that's how it seems! As said by <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/17/json-feed" title="John Gruber at Daring Fireball">John Gruber</a>, it's written for real humans. JSON is everywhere nowadays, and it's very easy to parse! </p>

<p>As such I thought it would be nice to implement JSON feed here on this blog. Unfortunately there isn't yet a JSON feed plugin for <a href="https://getgrav.org" title="Grav, Content Management System">Grav</a>, however there is a <a href="https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-feed" title="Grav Feed Plugin">feed plugin</a> - which I was already using to provide RSS. As such I decided to do a bit of playing with it, and a <a href="https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-feed/pull/21" title="My GitHub pull requests for Grav Feed Plugin">pull request</a> or two later there will be a JSON feed! In the mean time I've already implemented it locally.</p>
<p>And just for fun, I made a workflow where you can read JSON feeds: <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/527a5cac66ee40ce9899b642cf84eb94" title="JSON Feed Reader Workflow">JSON Feed Reader</a>, to keep the Workflow from getting too long (and because it was just a proof of concept), the article you select is opened in the in app Safari window and there's no tracking which articles you have or haven't read.</p>
