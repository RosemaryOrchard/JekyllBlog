  In the latest episode of Automators David and I got a chance to talk to Don
  McAllister about the systems and processes he has built over the years to
  automate ScreenCastsOnline. As a recent addition to their team, it was a fun
  look behind that side of the curtain, and I hope the system and processes Don
  has in place will inspire you!
