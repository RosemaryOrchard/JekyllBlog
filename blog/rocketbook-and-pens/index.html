<p>On the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/automators/96">latest episode of Automators</a> with <a href="https://mikah.co">Mikah Sargent</a>, we went down a little bit of a rabbit hole with my RocketBook. After the show, both Sparky and Mikah decided to give it a try! Since then I’ve been contacted by a few people asking about my RocketBook, so here are the full details.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/3Hnq5lf">RocketBook Core</a>, in A4 dot grid. A4 is big enough that I have plenty of space to draw out diagrams, and the dot grid lets me draw and write neatly, without lines getting in my way.</p>

<p>I use a combination of the <a href="https://amzn.to/3poiHzX">Pilot Frixion Fineliners</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/357QcQh">Pilot Frixion Markers</a>. These are a bit thicker than the Pilot Frixion rollerball that comes with the RocketBook pack, but I find this works better for my handwriting—and the ink is much easier to erase.</p>

<p>Erasing is easy, you just use a microfibre cloth (one comes with the RocketBook), and some water. I keep a small spray bottle of tap water in my office for plants, and cleaning my RocketBook.</p>

<p>There’s something incredibly satisfying about finishing something and then erasing your notes afterwards.</p>
