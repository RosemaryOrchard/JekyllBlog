<p>Time is hard, and moreso when you and your friends are spread out around the world. Fortunately, technology can help us handle these things!</p>

<p>Discord has a feature where if you paste a time code with specific formatting, it displays it in the local timezone for each user, but creating these manually is cumbersone - and prone to error. So some <a href="https://tildy.dev">friends of mine</a> pooled their skills and made a little app to do it, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/elsewhen/id1588708173">Elsewhen</a>. Whilst it was in beta, <a href="http://twitter.com/imyke">Myke Hurley</a> asked for a format to share times formatted for his <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke/status/1450853405740699651">Friday Keyboard Club</a>, which is a list of times with an emoji flag to indicate the timezone - and within what seemed like no time, the app gained “Myke Mode”! (Officially known as “Time List”, but in my heart, and the source code, it’s called Myke Mode.)</p>

<p>The app is out now and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/elsewhen/id1588708173">free to download</a>!</p>
