<p>I've been asked several times since yesterday how to open a workflow.is link in Shortcuts. Currently clicking on one takes you to the gallery of Shortcuts and nothing else happens. If you copy the URL and use a very simple Shortcut then you can click the "Get Workflow" link and everything works as expected.</p>

<p>The iCloud links for Shortcuts seem to be having difficulties at the moment - so you may want to just recreate this one by hand.</p>
