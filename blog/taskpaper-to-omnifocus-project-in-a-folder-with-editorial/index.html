<p>When OmniGroup first added Taskpaper support to OmniFocus they published an Editorial workflow which allows you to create new project - in the Mac Power Users Facebook Group someone asked if you could specify which folder the project should go into, a few minimal tweaks later and here is the solution! The key changes were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask the user which folder they want to save the project in.</li>
<li>URL encode the folder name.</li>
<li>Modify the X-Callback URL so the project would be saved to the specified folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get OmniGroup's original Editorial workflow from <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omnifocus-for-ios-now-automation-ready">their blog post here</a>, and the modification to allow you to add directly to a folder is available here: <a href="http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5903282794921984/B7PmEGtLdT8">New OmniFocus Project in Folder</a></p>
