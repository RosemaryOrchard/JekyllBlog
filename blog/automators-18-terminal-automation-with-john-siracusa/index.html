  On episode 18 of Automators David and I interviewed John Siracusa, web
  developer, Perl fan, and former reviewer of Mac OS X (as it was then) for Ars
  Technica. John was a wonderful guest on the show - we talked about what
  automation he does, and doesn't do - as well as the how and the why! Like many
  of our listeners John is very much a Mac first user - I hope you enjoy the
  show!
