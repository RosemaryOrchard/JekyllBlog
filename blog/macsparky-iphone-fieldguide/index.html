I expect you all think of me as a power user, and I class myself in that category as well, but I was <em>very</em> pleasantly surprised to find how many tricks I was missing on my iPhone! </p>

<p>For those of you not familiar with a MacSparky field guide be prepared, this is not just a book. In fact, I would say it’s a "Beauty and the Beast" book - though without the singing. This book has videos embedded in it, over two hours of them where David demonstrates these features. The book is split into 44 chapters, and multiple sections within each chapter. A chapter tends to be an area such as Email, with sections being a look at the apps available. You even get tips and tricks such as how to use Fantastical's natural language parser to add an alert to an event when creating it, or which calculator application has an augmented reality mode in it. You can see the <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/iphone">full chapter list here</a>.</p>
<p>David’s done a great job here; the whole book is jam-packed full of knowledge - even for power users. I’m going to be buying a few copies for my family and best of all these tips and tricks can be used to enhance your iPad usage too. The only thing you should be aware of is that you'll most likely buy at least one app because of this book! </p>
