<p>My theme for my talks at MacStock 2019 was "Sirify Your Life", in my main talk I covered how we can train Siri and directly add "simple" Shortcuts - like checking for upcoming packages in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id290986013?at=1010lumu">Deliveries</a>, or finding your keys with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id664939913?at=1010lumu">Tile</a>. By far the most popular tip I shared though was the ability to turn on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphaff1d606/ios">type to Siri</a>, while this is an accessibility setting it's also great for those of us who are doing things like last minute preparation about a presentation on Siri whilst on a plane! And everyone who prefers to type rather than talk as well. Lots of people were really interested by the <a href="https://getdrafts.com/editor/dictation">endless dictation</a> feature in <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> too.</p>
<p>In my deeper dive I went into building Shortcuts - truly making Siri do what you want! I built three Shortcuts:</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3551f3d0070f4b89b670e62319db0713">Directions to Event</a></h2>
<p>This is something almost everyone can use, getting your next event with an address and plotting directions to it - messaging someone to let them know how long it will take you to get there, and finally starting your favourite playlist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f43833c5ddf849ada93b0c5580c807a3">Forgotten Groceries</a></h2>
<p>The next Shortcut I demoed building was one to help you avoid forgetting things at the grocery store - I frequently forget to buy chocolate and cookies (two vital parts of my diet!) and this is a Shortcut which is easy to modify and use - meaning you won't forget the commonly purchased items at the store!</p>
<p><em>Please note, the Reminders list here should be replaced with a "Grocery" or "Shopping" list.</em><br />

<h2><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b3d03ca608224f01a8e308ce6599075d">Daily Log</a></h2>
<p>The final Shortcut was much more in line with the year's theme: Create. One of the many things people aspire to do, myself included, is journal. Journalling can be hard though so I showed how you can start by automating it!<br />
<em>Please note, the Reminders list here should be replaced with a "Goals" list.</em><br />
